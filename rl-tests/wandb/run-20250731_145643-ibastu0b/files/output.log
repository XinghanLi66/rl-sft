Find the sum of all complex solutions of the equation
\[\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4.\]<|im_end|>

To solve the given equation, we need to find the sum of all complex solutions of the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4.
\]

First, let's rewrite the equation in a more manageable form. We can introduce a new variable \( y = x^2 \), so the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{y - 1} + \frac{2}{y - 2} + \frac{3}{y - 3} + \frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010x - 4.
\]

This equation is quite complex, and solving it directly might be challenging. Instead, we can use a numerical approach to find the solutions. However, we can also use some algebraic manipulation to simplify the problem.

Let's consider the left-hand side of the equation. We can combine the fractions over a common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{y - 1} + \frac{2}{y - 2} + \frac{3}{y - 3} + \frac{4}{y - 4} = \frac{(y-2)(y-3)(y-4) + 2(y-1)(y-3)(y-4) + 3(y-1)(y-2)(y-4) + 4(y-1)(y-2)(y-3)}{(y-1)(y-2)(y-3)(y-4)}.
\]

The numerator of this fraction is a polynomial of degree 3, and the denominator is a polynomial of degree 4. The right-hand side of the equation is a linear function of \( x \). To find the solutions, we need to equate the two sides and solve for \( y \). However, since the equation is quite complex, we can use a numerical approach to find the solutions.

Let's use Python to find the solutions numerically. We'll use the `numpy` library to find the roots of the polynomial equation.
```python
import numpy as np

# Define the polynomial coefficients for the left-hand side of the equation
# The polynomial is obtained by combining the fractions over a common denominator
# and simplifying the resulting expression.
coefficients = np.poly1d([1, -10, 35, -50, 24])

# Find the roots of the polynomial
roots = np.roots(coefficients)

# The roots are the values of y = x^2. We need to find the corresponding x values.
# Each root y will give us two solutions x = sqrt(y) and x = -sqrt(y).
solutions = []
for root in roots:
    if root >= 0:  # Only consider real roots
        solutions.append(np.sqrt(root))
        solutions.append(-np.sqrt(root))

# Sum all the solutions
sum_of_solutions = sum(solutions)
print(sum_of_solutions)
```
```output
0j
```
The sum of all complex solutions of the equation is \( \boxed{0} \).<|endoftext|>
