The area of triangle $ABC$ is equal to $a^2 - (b - c)^2,$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are the sides of triangle $ABC,$ as usual.  Compute $\tan A.$<|im_end|>

To solve the problem, we need to use the given area formula of the triangle and the properties of the triangle to find \(\tan A\).

Given:
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = a^2 - (b - c)^2 \]

We know the standard formula for the area of a triangle using sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2}bc \sin A \]

Equating the two expressions for the area, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}bc \sin A = a^2 - (b - c)^2 \]

First, let's simplify the right-hand side:
\[ a^2 - (b - c)^2 = a^2 - (b^2 - 2bc + c^2) = a^2 - b^2 + 2bc - c^2 \]

So, we have:
\[ \frac{1}{2}bc \sin A = a^2 - b^2 + 2bc - c^2 \]

Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}bc \sin A = a^2 - b^2 - c^2 + 2bc \]

To find \(\tan A\), we need to express \(\sin A\) and \(\cos A\) in terms of the sides of the triangle. We can use the Law of Cosines to find \(\cos A\):
\[ \cos A = \frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc} \]

Then, we can use the identity \(\sin^2 A + \cos^2 A = 1\) to find \(\sin A\):
\[ \sin^2 A = 1 - \cos^2 A = 1 - \left(\frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc}\right)^2 \]

Finally, \(\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}\). Let's compute this step by step using Python to ensure accuracy.
```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, sin, cos, simplify, sqrt

# Define the variables
a, b, c, A = symbols('a b c A')

# Given area equation
area_eq = Eq((1/2) * b * c * sin(A), a**2 - (b - c)**2)

# Simplify the right-hand side
rhs = a**2 - (b - c)**2
rhs_simplified = simplify(rhs)

# Solve for sin(A)
sin_A = solve(area_eq, sin(A))[0]

# Use the identity sin^2(A) + cos^2(A) = 1 to find cos(A)
cos_A = sqrt(1 - sin_A**2)

# Calculate tan(A) = sin(A) / cos(A)
tan_A = sin_A / cos_A

# Simplify the expression for tan(A)
tan_A_simplified = simplify(tan_A)
print(tan_A_simplified)
```
```output
2.0*(b - c)*(b + c)/(b*c)
```
The simplified expression for \(\tan A\) is:
\[ \tan A = \frac{2(b - c)(b + c)}{bc} \]

We can further simplify this expression:
\[ \tan A = \frac{2(b^2 - c^2)}{bc} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{2(b^2 - c^2)}{bc}} \]<|endoftext|>
