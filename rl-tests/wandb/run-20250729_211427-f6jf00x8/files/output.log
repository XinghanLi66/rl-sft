It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

Let $P(x)$ be a quadratic polynomial with real coefficients satisfying $x^2 - 2x + 2 \le P(x) \le 2x^2 - 4x + 3$ for all real  numbers $x$, and suppose $P(11) = 181$. Find $P(16)$.<|im_end|>

To solve this problem, we need to determine the quadratic polynomial \(P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\) that satisfies the given conditions. Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Understand the Inequality:**
   The inequality \(x^2 - 2x + 2 \le P(x) \le 2x^2 - 4x + 3\) must hold for all real numbers \(x\). This means that \(P(x)\) must lie between the two quadratic polynomials \(x^2 - 2x + 2\) and \(2x^2 - 4x + 3\).

2. **Formulate the Polynomial:**
   Since \(P(x)\) is a quadratic polynomial, we can write it as \(P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\). We need to find the coefficients \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that the inequality holds.

3. **Determine the Coefficients:**
   To find the coefficients, we can use the fact that \(P(x)\) must be equal to the midpoint of the two quadratic polynomials at some point. The midpoint of \(x^2 - 2x + 2\) and \(2x^2 - 4x + 3\) is:
   \[
   \frac{(x^2 - 2x + 2) + (2x^2 - 4x + 3)}{2} = \frac{3x^2 - 6x + 5}{2} = \frac{3}{2}x^2 - 3x + \frac{5}{2}
   \]
   This suggests that \(P(x) = \frac{3}{2}x^2 - 3x + \frac{5}{2}\). We need to verify that this polynomial satisfies the given conditions.

4. **Verify the Polynomial:**
   We need to check if \(P(x) = \frac{3}{2}x^2 - 3x + \frac{5}{2}\) satisfies the inequality \(x^2 - 2x + 2 \le P(x) \le 2x^2 - 4x + 3\). We can do this by comparing the polynomials:
   \[
   x^2 - 2x + 2 \le \frac{3}{2}x^2 - 3x + \frac{5}{2} \le 2x^2 - 4x + 3
   \]
   Simplifying the left inequality:
   \[
   x^2 - 2x + 2 \le \frac{3}{2}x^2 - 3x + \frac{5}{2} \implies 0 \le \frac{1}{2}x^2 - x + \frac{1}{2} \implies 0 \le (x-1)^2
   \]
   This is true for all \(x\). Simplifying the right inequality:
   \[
   \frac{3}{2}x^2 - 3x + \frac{5}{2} \le 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \implies 0 \le \frac{1}{2}x^2 - x + \frac{1}{2} \implies 0 \le (x-1)^2
   \]
   This is also true for all \(x\). Therefore, \(P(x) = \frac{3}{2}x^2 - 3x + \frac{5}{2}\) satisfies the inequality.

5. **Find \(P(16)\):**
   Now we can find \(P(16)\) by substituting \(x = 16\) into the polynomial:
   \[
   P(16) = \frac{3}{2}(16)^2 - 3(16) + \frac{5}{2} = \frac{3}{2}(256) - 48 + \frac{5}{2} = 384 - 48 + \frac{5}{2} = 336 + \frac{5}{2} = \frac{672}{2} + \frac{5}{2} = \frac{677}{2}
   \]

Let's implement this in Python to verify our solution:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variable
x = sp.symbols('x')

# Define the polynomial P(x)
P = (3/2)*x**2 - 3*x + 5/2

# Calculate P(16)
P_16 = P.subs(x, 16)
print(P_16)
```
```output
338.500000000000
```
The output confirms that \(P(16) = \frac{677}{2} = 338.5\). Therefore, the value of \(P(16)\) is \(\boxed{338.5}\).<|endoftext|>
