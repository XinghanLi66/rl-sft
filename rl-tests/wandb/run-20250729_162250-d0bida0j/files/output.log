On a particular map, $3$ inches on the map equates to $10$ miles in real life. If you know that the real life distance between two buildings on the map is $53.25$ miles, what would the distance between the buildings be (in inches) on the map, expressed as a fraction?<|im_end|>

To solve this problem, we need to determine the scale of the map and then use that scale to find the distance on the map that corresponds to a real-life distance of 53.25 miles.

The scale of the map is given as 3 inches on the map equating to 10 miles in real life. This means that 1 inch on the map corresponds to $\frac{10}{3}$ miles in real life.

To find the distance on the map that corresponds to 53.25 miles in real life, we can set up the following proportion:

\[
\text{Distance on map} = \frac{53.25 \text{ miles}}{\frac{10}{3} \text{ miles per inch}}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\text{Distance on map} = 53.25 \times \frac{3}{10} \text{ inches}
\]

Let's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.
```python
# Given values
real_life_distance = 53.25  # in miles
scale_factor = 10 / 3  # miles per inch

# Calculate the distance on the map
distance_on_map = real_life_distance / scale_factor
print(distance_on_map)
```
```output
15.975
```
The distance between the buildings on the map is 15.975 inches. To express this as a fraction, we recognize that 15.975 is the same as $\frac{639}{40}$.

So, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{639}{40}}
