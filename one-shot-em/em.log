The following values were not passed to `accelerate launch` and had defaults used instead:
	`--num_processes` was set to a value of `8`
		More than one GPU was found, enabling multi-GPU training.
		If this was unintended please pass in `--num_processes=1`.
	`--num_machines` was set to a value of `1`
	`--mixed_precision` was set to a value of `'no'`
	`--dynamo_backend` was set to a value of `'no'`
To avoid this warning pass in values for each of the problematic parameters or run `accelerate config`.

Question: The pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). When the velocity is \( 8 \) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \( 2 \) square feet is \( 4 \) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{{}}.
Answer: To solve the problem, we start by writing the mathematical relationship for the pressure \( P \):
\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]
where \( k \) is a constant. We need to find \( k \) using the given information:
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]
Solving for \( k \):
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = 1024k \]
\[ k = \frac{{4}}{{1024}} \]
\[ k = \frac{{1}}{{256}} \]
Now we use this value of \( k \) to find the velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P \) on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds:
\[ 32 = \frac{{1}}{{256}} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{{V^3}}{{64}} \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{{2048}} \]
\[ V = 12.8 \]
Thus, the wind velocity is \( \boxed{{12.8}} \) miles per hour.

Question: The pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). When the velocity is \( 8 \) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \( 2 \) square feet is \( 4 \) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{{}}.
Answer: To solve the problem, we start by writing the mathematical relationship for the pressure \( P \):
\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]
where \( k \) is a constant. We need to find \( k \) using the given information:
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]
Solving for \( k \):
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = 1024k \]
\[ k = \frac{{4}}{{1024}} \]
\[ k = \frac{{1}}{{256}} \]
Now we use this value of \( k \) to find the velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P \) on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds:
\[ 32 = \frac{{1}}{{256}} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{{V^3}}{{64}} \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{{2048}} \]
\[ V = 12.8 \]
Thus, the wind velocity is \( \boxed{{12.8}} \) miles per hour.

Question: The pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). When the velocity is \( 8 \) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \( 2 \) square feet is \( 4 \) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{{}}.
Answer: To solve the problem, we start by writing the mathematical relationship for the pressure \( P \):
\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]
where \( k \) is a constant. We need to find \( k \) using the given information:
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]
Solving for \( k \):
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = 1024k \]
\[ k = \frac{{4}}{{1024}} \]
\[ k = \frac{{1}}{{256}} \]
Now we use this value of \( k \) to find the velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P \) on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds:
\[ 32 = \frac{{1}}{{256}} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{{V^3}}{{64}} \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{{2048}} \]
\[ V = 12.8 \]
Thus, the wind velocity is \( \boxed{{12.8}} \) miles per hour.

When the velocity is \( 8 \) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \( 2 \) square feet is \( 4 \) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds.

Question: The pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). When the velocity is \( 8 \) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \( 2 \) square feet is \( 4 \) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{{}}.
Answer: To solve the problem, we start by writing the mathematical relationship for the pressure \( P \):
\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]
where \( k \) is a constant. We need to find \( k \) using the given information:
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]
Solving for \( k \):
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = 1024k \]
\[ k = \frac{{4}}{{1024}} \]
\[ k = \frac{{1}}{{256}} \]
Now we use this value of \( k \) to find the velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P \) on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds:
\[ 32 = \frac{{1}}{{256}} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{{V^3}}{{64}} \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{{2048}} \]
\[ V = 12.8 \]
Thus, the wind velocity is \( \boxed{{12.8}} \) miles per hour.
