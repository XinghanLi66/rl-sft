When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: Find the sum of all integer bases $b>9$ for which $17_{b}$ is a divisor of $97_{b}$.\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\).

Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: Let $k$ be real numbers such that the system $|25+20i-z|=5$ and $|z-4-k|=|z-3i-k|$ has exactly one complex solution $z$.

He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm.

Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\).

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: Let $ S $ be the set of vertices of a regular 24-gon.

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: The 9 members of a baseball team went to an ice cream parlor after their game.

Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\).

For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: Circle $\\omega_1$ with radius 6 centered at point $A$ is internally tangent at point $B$ to circle $\\omega_2$ with radius 15.

He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: Sixteen chairs are arranged in a row.

Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: On $\\triangle ABC$ points $A,D,E$, and $B$ lie that order on side $\\overline{AB}$ with $AD=4, DE=16$, and $EB=8$.

Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\).

Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: The parabola with equation $y=x^{2}-4$ is rotated $60^{\\circ}$ counterclockwise around the origin.

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: Six points $ A, B, C, D, E, $ and $ F $ lie in a straight line in that order.

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: From an unlimited supply of 1-cent coins, 10-cent coins, and 25-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $ N $ cents, where $ N $ is a positive integer. He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: Alex divides a disk into four quadrants with two perpendicular diameters intersecting at the center of the disk.

Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\).

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: A piecewise linear periodic function is defined by $f(x)=\\begin{cases}x&\\text{if }x\\in[-1,1)\\\\2-x&\\text{if }x\\in[1,3)\\end{cases}$ and $f(x+4)=f(x)$ for all real numbers $x$.

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: Four unit squares form a $2 \\times 2$ grid.

There exist points $ K $ and $ L $ inside the triangle such that $ AK = AL = BK = CL = KL = 14. $ The area of the quadrilateral $ BKLC $ can be expressed as $ n \\sqrt{3} $ for some positive integer $ n $. Find $ n $.\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nAnswer: To find the area of the quadrilateral \\( BKLC \\) in the given right triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) with \\( \\angle A = 90^\\circ \\) and \\( BC = 38 \\), we need to analyze the geometric configuration. Given that \\( AK = AL = BK = CL = KL = 14 \\), we can infer that \\( K \\) and \\( L \\) are points such that \\( \\triangle AKL \\) and \\( \\triangle BCL \\) are equilateral triangles with side length 14. The quadrilateral \\( BKLC \\) consists of two equilateral triangles \\( \\triangle BCL \\) and \\( \\triangle AKL \\) minus the overlapping part, which is another equilateral triangle \\( \\triangle AKL \\).\n\nThe area of an equilateral triangle with side length \\( s \\) is given by \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \\). Therefore, the area of each equilateral triangle with side length 14 is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\cdot 14^2 = 49\\sqrt{3} \\).\n\nThe area of the quadrilateral \\( BKLC \\) is the sum of the areas of \\( \\triangle BCL \\) and \\( \\triangle AKL \\) minus the overlapping area (which is also \\( \\triangle AKL \\)). Since the overlapping area is already included in both \\( \\triangle BCL \\) and \\( \\triangle AKL \\), we simply add the areas of \\( \\triangle BCL \\) and \\( \\triangle AKL \\) and then subtract the area of \\( \\triangle AKL \\) again to avoid double counting. Therefore, the area of the quadrilateral \\( BKLC \\) is \\( 49\\sqrt{3} + 49\\sqrt{3} - 49\\sqrt{3} = 49\\sqrt{3} \\).\n\nThus, the area of the quadrilateral \\( BKLC \\) is \\( 49\\sqrt{3} \\), and the value of \\( n \\) is \\( 49 \\).\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python code implementation.\n```python\nimport math\r\n\r\n# Side length of the equilateral triangles\r\nside_length = 14\r\n\r\n# Area of an equilateral triangle\r\narea_equilateral_triangle = (math.sqrt(3) / 4) * (side_length ** 2)\r\n\r\n# Area of quadrilateral BKLC\r\narea_BKLC = 2 * area_equilateral_triangle - area_equilateral_triangle\r\nn = int(area_BKLC / math.sqrt(3))\r\n\r\nprint(n)\n```\n```output\n49\n```\n",

Find the number of ways to draw 12 segments of equal lengths so that each vertex in $ S $ is an endpoint of exactly one of the 12 segments.\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nAnswer: To determine the number of ways to draw 12 segments of equal lengths so that each vertex in a regular 24-gon is an endpoint of exactly one of the 12 segments, we need to consider the problem of pairing the vertices of the 24-gon. Each pair of vertices will be connected by a segment of equal length. This is equivalent to finding the number of perfect matchings in a 24-vertex cycle graph.\n\nA perfect matching in a graph is a set of edges such that each vertex is incident to exactly one edge in the set. For a cycle graph with an even number of vertices, the number of perfect matchings is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of perfect matchings} = (n-1)!! = (n-1) \\times (n-3) \\times (n-5) \\times \\cdots \\times 1 \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of vertices, and \\( !! \\) denotes the double factorial, which is the product of all the odd integers up to \\( n-1 \\).\n\nFor a 24-gon, \\( n = 24 \\), so the number of perfect matchings is:\n\n\\[ 23 \\times 21 \\times 19 \\times 17 \\times 15 \\times 13 \\times 11 \\times 9 \\times 7 \\times 5 \\times 3 \\times 1 \\]\n\nWe can calculate this product using Python. Let's do that.\n```python\nfrom functools import reduce\n\n# Function to calculate the double factorial of an odd number\ndef double_factorial(n):\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 1\n    return n * double_factorial(n - 2)\n\n# Calculate the number of perfect matchings for a 24-gon\nn = 24\nnumber_of_perfect_matchings = double_factorial(n - 1)\nprint(number_of_perfect_matchings)\n```\n```output\n316234143225\n```\n",

Each of the 12 unit line segments forming the sides of the squares is colored either red or blue in such a way that each unit square has 2 red sides and 2 blue sides. Find the number of such colorings.\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nAnswer: To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to color the 12 unit line segments of a $2 \\times 2$ grid such that each unit square has 2 red sides and 2 blue sides. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Grid:**\n   - The grid consists of 4 unit squares arranged in a $2 \\times 2$ pattern.\n   - Each unit square has 4 sides, and we need to color them such that 2 sides are red and 2 sides are blue.\n   - There are a total of 12 unit line segments (4 horizontal and 4 vertical).\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - Each of the 4 unit squares must have exactly 2 red sides and 2 blue sides.\n\n3. **Counting the Colorings:**\n   - We can start by coloring the first square. There are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to choose which 2 of the 4 sides will be red (the rest will be blue).\n   - Once the first square is colored, the adjacent squares will have to be colored in a way that maintains the 2 red and 2 blue sides rule.\n   - We can use a systematic approach to count all valid colorings.\n\nLet's implement this in Python using sympy to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the grid and the sides\nsides = ['top1', 'bottom1', 'top2', 'bottom2', 'left1', 'right1', 'left2', 'right2']\n\n# Function to check if a coloring is valid\ndef is_valid_coloring(coloring):\n    # Check the first square\n    if coloring['top1'] != coloring['bottom1'] or coloring['top1'] != coloring['top2'] or coloring['bottom1'] != coloring['bottom2']:\n        return False\n    # Check the second square\n    if coloring['top2'] != coloring['bottom2'] or coloring['top2'] != coloring['top1'] or coloring['bottom2'] != coloring['bottom1']:\n        return False\n    # Check the third square\n    if coloring['top1'] != coloring['bottom1'] or coloring['top1'] != coloring['top2'] or coloring['bottom1'] != coloring['bottom2']:\n        return False\n    # Check the fourth square\n    if coloring['top2'] != coloring['bottom2'] or coloring['top2'] != coloring['top1'] or coloring['bottom2'] != coloring['bottom1']:\n        return False\n    return True\n\n# Generate all possible colorings\ncolorings = list(itertools.product(['R', 'B'], repeat=8))\n\n# Filter valid colorings\nvalid_colorings = [coloring for coloring in colorings if is_valid_coloring(dict(zip(sides, coloring)))]\n\n# Count the number of valid colorings\nnum_valid_colorings = len(valid_colorings)\nprint(num_valid_colorings)\n```\n```output\n32\n```\n"
