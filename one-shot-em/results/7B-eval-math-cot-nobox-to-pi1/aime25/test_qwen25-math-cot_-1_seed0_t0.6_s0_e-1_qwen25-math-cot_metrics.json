Let $N$ be the number of these integers that are divisible by 22. Find the difference between $N$ and 2025. \n Answer: To solve the problem, we need to find the number of 8-digit integers that use each of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 exactly once and are divisible by 22. A number is divisible by 22 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 11. \n\n1. **Divisibility by 2**: The last digit of the number must be even. So, the last digit can be one of {2, 4, 6, 8}.\n2. **Divisibility by 11**: A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions is a multiple of 11. Let's denote the digits of the number as $d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5, d_6, d_7, d_8$. The condition for divisibility by 11 is $(d_1 + d_3 + d_5 + d_7) - (d_2 + d_4 + d_6 + d_8) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n\nLet's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Choose the last digit**: There are 4 choices for the last digit (2, 4, 6, or 8).\n2. **Arrange the remaining 7 digits**: The remaining 7 digits must satisfy the divisibility rule by 11. We need to count the number of valid permutations of these 7 digits.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the number of valid permutations and then calculate the difference between $N$ and 2025.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Digits to be used\ndigits = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n\n# Function to check if a permutation is divisible by 11\ndef is_divisible_by_11(perm):\n    odd_sum = perm[0] + perm[2] + perm[4] + perm[6]\n    even_sum = perm[1] + perm[3] + perm[5] + perm[7]\n    return (odd_sum - even_sum) % 11 == 0\n\n# Count the number of valid permutations\ncount = 0\nfor last_digit in [2, 4, 6, 8]:\n    remaining_digits = digits.copy()\n    remaining_digits.remove(last_digit)\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(remaining_digits):\n        if is_divisible_by_11(perm):\n            count += 1\n\n# The number of valid 8-digit integers\nN = count\n\n# Calculate the difference between N and 2025\ndifference = abs(N - 2025)\n\nprint(difference)\n```\n```output\nIndexError: tuple index out of range\n```\n",

Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$. \n Answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ordered triples of positive integers $(a, b, c)$ such that $a, b, c \\leq 3^6$ and $a^3 + b^3 + c^3$ is a multiple of $3^7$. We will then find the remainder when this number is divided by 1000.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the problem. We know that $a, b, c \\leq 3^6 = 729$. We need to count the number of ordered triples $(a, b, c)$ such that $a^3 + b^3 + c^3$ is divisible by $3^7 = 2187$.\n\nWe can use modular arithmetic to simplify the problem. Specifically, we need to consider the cubes modulo $3^7$. We will use the fact that any integer $x$ can be written as $x = 3k + r$ where $r \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 2186\\}$. Then, $x^3 \\equiv r^3 \\pmod{2187}$. We need to find the cubes of all numbers from 1 to 729 modulo 2187 and count the number of valid triples.\n\nLet's use Python to find the solution. We will first compute the cubes modulo 2187 for all numbers from 1 to 729. Then, we will count the number of valid triples $(a, b, c)$ such that $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2187}$.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Calculate the cubes modulo 2187 for all numbers from 1 to 729\ncubes = [i**3 % 2187 for i in range(1, 730)]\n\n# Count the number of valid triples (a, b, c)\ncount = 0\nfor a, b, c in itertools.product(range(1, 730), repeat=3):\n    if (cubes[a-1] + cubes[b-1] + cubes[c-1]) % 2187 == 0:\n        count += 1\n\n# Find the remainder when the count is divided by 1000\nremainder = count % 1000\nprint(remainder)\n```\n```output\nTimeout Error\n```\n",

The probability that $ B $ is a nonempty set with the property that the least common multiple of its elements is 2025 is $ \\frac{m}{n} $, where $ m $ and $ n $ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $ m + n $. \n Answer: To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the divisors of 2025**: First, we factorize 2025 into its prime factors. \\(2025 = 3^4 \\times 5^2\\). The divisors of 2025 are all numbers of the form \\(3^a \\times 5^b\\) where \\(0 \\leq a \\leq 4\\) and \\(0 \\leq b \\leq 2\\). This gives us a total of \\((4+1)(2+1) = 15\\) divisors.\n2. **Determine the total number of subsets of $A$**: The set $A$ has 15 elements, so the total number of subsets of $A$ is \\(2^{15}\\). Since we are looking for nonempty subsets, we exclude the empty set, so we have \\(2^{15} - 1\\) possible subsets.\n3. **Count the number of valid subsets**: A subset $B$ of $A$ is valid if the least common multiple (LCM) of its elements is 2025. To have the LCM of the elements of $B$ equal to 2025, the subset $B$ must include at least one factor of \\(3^4\\) and at least one factor of \\(5^2\\). The valid subsets can be counted by considering the inclusion-exclusion principle. We need to count the subsets that include at least one divisor with \\(3^4\\) and at least one divisor with \\(5^2\\).\n4. **Calculate the probability**: The probability is the ratio of the number of valid subsets to the total number of nonempty subsets. This probability will be in the form \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\), and we need to find \\(m + n\\).\n\nLet's implement this step-by-step in Python using sympy:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Define the divisors of 2025\ndivisors = [3**a * 5**b for a in range(5) for b in range(3)]\n\n# Function to check if the LCM of a subset is 2025\ndef is_valid_subset(subset):\n    lcm_value = sp.lcm([d for d in subset])\n    return lcm_value == 2025\n\n# Total number of nonempty subsets\ntotal_subsets = 2**15 - 1\n\n# Count the number of valid subsets\nvalid_subsets = 0\nfor i in range(1, 15 + 1):\n    for subset in combinations(divisors, i):\n        if is_valid_subset(subset):\n            valid_subsets += 1\n\n# Calculate the probability\nm, n = sp.Rational(valid_subsets, total_subsets).as_numer_denom()\n\n# Output the result\nresult = m + n\nprint(result)\n```\n```output\n60671\n```\n",

The greedy algorithm fails when there exists another combination of coins that uses fewer coins to make up the value $ N $. We will iterate through all values of $ N $ from 1 to 1000 and check if the greedy algorithm succeeds for each value.\n\nThe greedy algorithm will fail for a value $ N $ if there exists a smaller value $ M $ such that $ N - M $ can be made up using fewer coins than the greedy algorithm would suggest.

Eight people each select a chair in which to sit so that no person sits next to two other people. Let $ N $ be the number of subsets of 16 chairs that could be selected. Find the remainder when $ N $ is divided by 1000. \n Answer: To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to select 8 chairs out of 16 such that no two selected chairs are adjacent. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to arrange 8 non-adjacent people in 16 chairs.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Conceptualize the Problem:**\n   - We need to place 8 people in 16 chairs such that no two people are adjacent.\n   - This is equivalent to choosing 8 positions for the people out of 16, with the condition that no two chosen positions are consecutive.\n\n2. **Transform the Problem:**\n   - If we place 8 people in 16 chairs such that no two are adjacent, we can think of it as choosing 8 positions for the people and then placing a \"gap\" chair between each pair of people.\n   - This means we need to choose 8 positions from 9 possible slots (since we need 7 gaps between the 8 people and 1 extra slot at the end).\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Ways:**\n   - The number of ways to choose 8 positions from 9 slots is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{9}{8}\\).\n   - This simplifies to 9, since \\(\\binom{9}{8} = \\binom{9}{1} = 9\\).\n\n4. **Find the Remainder When Divided by 1000:**\n   - Since \\(N = 9\\), we need to find \\(9 \\mod 1000\\), which is simply 9.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to confirm our reasoning:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the number of ways to choose 8 positions from 9 slots\nN = math.comb(9, 8)\n\n# Find the remainder when N is divided by 1000\nremainder = N % 1000\n\nprint(remainder)\n```\n```output\n9\n```\n"
