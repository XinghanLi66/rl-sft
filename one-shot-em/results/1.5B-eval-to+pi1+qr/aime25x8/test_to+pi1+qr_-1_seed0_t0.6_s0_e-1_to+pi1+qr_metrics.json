Find the expected number of regions into which these 27 line segments divide the disk. \n Answer: To solve this problem, we need to understand the effect of each line segment on the number of regions created. When a line segment is drawn, it can intersect with other line segments, thus creating additional regions. The expected number of regions created by \\( n \\) line segments can be derived from combinatorial principles.\n\nThe formula for the expected number of regions \\( R(n) \\) created by \\( n \\) line segments in a disk is given by:\n\\[ R(n) = \\frac{n^2 + n + 2}{2} \\]\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of line segments.

Suppose that $ G $ is a point not on the line and that $ AC = 26 $, $ BD = 22 $, $ CE = 31 $, $ DF = 33 $, $ AF = 73 $, $ CG = 40 $, and $ DG = 30 $. Find the area of $ \\triangle BGE $. \n Answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the coordinates of the points and then use the area formula for a triangle. We can place points $A, B, C, D, E, F$ on the x-axis with coordinates $A(0,0)$, $B(b,0)$, $C(c,0)$, $D(d,0)$, $E(e,0)$, and $F(f,0)$.\n\nGiven:\n\\[ AC = 26 \\implies c = 26 \\]\n\\[ BD = 22 \\implies d = b + 22 \\]\n\\[ CE = 31 \\implies e = c + 31 = 26 + 31 = 57 \\]\n\\[ DF = 33 \\implies f = d + 33 = b + 22 + 33 = b + 55 \\]\n\\[ AF = 73 \\implies f = 73 \\]\nFrom the above, we can solve for $b$:\n\\[ b + 55 = 73 \\implies b = 18 \\]\nSo the coordinates are:\n\\[ A(0,0), B(18,0), C(26,0), D(40,0), E(57,0), F(73,0) \\]\nPoint $G$ is not on the line, so let's place it at $G(x_G, y_G)$. We know:\n\\[ CG = 40 \\implies \\sqrt{(x_G - 26)^2 + y_G^2} = 40 \\]\n\\[ DG = 30 \\implies \\sqrt{(x_G - 40)^2 + y_G^2} = 30 \\]\nSquaring both equations, we get:\n\\[ (x_G - 26)^2 + y_G^2 = 1600 \\]\n\\[ (x_G - 40)^2 + y_G^2 = 900 \\]\nSubtracting the second equation from the first:\n\\[ (x_G - 26)^2 - (x_G - 40)^2 = 700 \\]\n\\[ (x_G - 26 + x_G - 40)(x_G - 26 - x_G + 40) = 700 \\]\n\\[ (2x_G - 66)(14) = 700 \\]\n\\[ 28x_G - 924 = 700 \\]\n\\[ 28x_G = 1624 \\]\n\\[ x_G = 58 \\]\nSubstituting $x_G = 58$ into $(x_G - 26)^2 + y_G^2 = 1600$:\n\\[ (58 - 26)^2 + y_G^2 = 1600 \\]\n\\[ 32^2 + y_G^2 = 1600 \\]\n\\[ 1024 + y_G^2 = 1600 \\]\n\\[ y_G^2 = 576 \\]\n\\[ y_G = 24 \\]\nSo the coordinates of $G$ are $G(58, 24)$. Now we need to find the area of $\\triangle BGE$. The base of the triangle is $BE = 57 - 18 = 39$. The height is the y-coordinate of $G$, which is 24. The area of the triangle is:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 39 \\times 24 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 936 = 468 \\]\nSo the area of $\\triangle BGE$ is $468$. The code to verify this is as follows:\n```python\n# Coordinates of points A, B, C, D, E, F\nA = (0, 0)\nB = (18, 0)\nC = (26, 0)\nD = (40, 0)\nE = (57, 0)\nF = (73, 0)\n\n# Coordinates of point G\nG = (58, 24)\n\n# Function to calculate the distance between two points\ndef distance(p1, p2):\n    return ((p1[0] - p2[0])**2 + (p1[1] - p2[1])**2)**0.5\n\n# Verify the distances\nAC = distance(A, C)\nBD = distance(B, D)\nCE = distance(C, E)\nDF = distance(D, F)\nAF = distance(A, F)\nCG = distance(C, G)\nDG = distance(D, G)\n\n# Calculate the area of triangle BGE\nbase = E[0] - B[0]\nheight = G[1]\narea = 0.5 * base * height\n\nprint(((AC, BD, CE, DF, AF, CG, DG, area)))\n```\n```output\n(26.0, 22.0, 31.0, 33.0, 73.0, 40.0, 30.0, 468.0)\n```\n",

This means that \\( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n + 2} \\). We can simplify this by using polynomial division or modular arithmetic. Let's rewrite \\( n \\) as \\( n = k - 2 \\) for some integer \\( k \\). Then \\( n + 2 = k \\), and we need to check when \\( 3(k - 2 + 3)((k - 2)^2 + 9) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{k} \\). This simplifies to \\( 3(k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 13) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{k} \\). Since \\( k \\) divides \\( k^2 - 4k \\), we only need to check the term \\( 3 \\cdot 13 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{k} \\), which means \\( k \\) must divide 39. The divisors of 39 are \\( \\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 13, \\pm 39 \\). Since \\( k = n + 2 \\) and \\( n \\) is a positive integer, \\( k \\) must be at least 3.

Find the number of ways to draw 12 segments of equal lengths so that each vertex in $ S $ is an endpoint of exactly one of the 12 segments. \n Answer: To solve this problem, we need to understand that we are essentially looking for the number of ways to pair up the vertices of a regular 24-gon such that each vertex is paired with exactly one other vertex, and the segments connecting these pairs are of equal length. This means we need to find the number of perfect matchings in a 24-gon where each matching consists of segments of equal length.\n\nFor a regular polygon with an even number of vertices, the number of ways to pair up the vertices is given by the double factorial of \\( (n-1) \\) for an \\( n \\)-sided polygon. For a 24-gon, the number of ways to pair up the vertices is \\( 23 \\times 21 \\times 19 \\times \\cdots \\times 1 \\).\n\nHowever, since we are drawing 12 segments of equal length, we can simplify this to finding the number of ways to choose 12 pairs out of 24 vertices, which is given by the number of perfect matchings in a 24-gon. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to divide 24 vertices into 12 pairs, which is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\frac{24!}{(2^12 \\cdot 12!)} \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the number of ways to pair up 24 vertices\nnum_ways = math.factorial(24) // (2**12 * math.factorial(12))\nprint(num_ways)\n```\n```output\n316234143225\n```\n",

The probability that $ B $ is a nonempty set with the property that the least common multiple of its elements is 2025 is $ \\frac{m}{n} $, where $ m $ and $ n $ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $ m + n $. \n Answer: To solve this problem, we start by finding the divisors of 2025. The prime factorization of 2025 is:\n\\[ 2025 = 3^4 \\cdot 5^2 \\]\nThe total number of divisors of 2025 is:\n\\[ (4 + 1)(2 + 1) = 5 \\cdot 3 = 15 \\]\nSo the set \\( A \\) has 15 elements. The total number of subsets of \\( A \\) is \\( 2^{15} \\). We need to count the number of subsets whose least common multiple (LCM) is 2025. For the LCM to be 2025, every prime factor of 2025 must appear in at least the required power in the subset. Specifically, for the prime factor 3, we need at least 3 factors of 3 (since \\( 3^3 \\) is the highest power of 3 in 2025), and for the prime factor 5, we need at least 2 factors of 5 (since \\( 5^2 \\) is the highest power of 5 in 2025). \n\nLet's count the valid subsets:\n1. The number of ways to choose the power of 3 (from 0 to 3) is 4.\n2. The number of ways to choose the power of 5 (from 0 to 2) is 3.\nThe total number of valid subsets is \\( 4 \\cdot 3 = 12 \\). Since we are excluding the empty subset, we have \\( 12 - 1 = 11 \\) valid subsets. The probability that a randomly selected nonempty subset has the LCM of 2025 is:\n\\[ \\frac{11}{2^{15} - 1} \\]\nWe need to simplify this fraction and find \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) such that \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are relatively prime. The denominator \\( 2^{15} - 1 \\) is 32767, and the fraction simplifies to \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\). Since the numerator is 11, and 11 and 32767 are relatively prime, we have \\( m = 11 \\) and \\( n = 32767 \\). Therefore, \\( m + n = 32778 \\). Let's confirm this with Python code.\n```python\nfrom math import gcd\n\n# Total number of divisors of 2025\ndivisors_count = 15\n\n# Total number of subsets\ntotal_subsets = 2 ** divisors_count\n\n# Number of valid subsets (excluding the empty subset)\nvalid_subsets = 4 * 3 - 1  # 4 choices for 3^0, 3^1, 3^2, 3^3 and 3 choices for 5^0, 5^1, 5^2\n\n# Probability in simplified form\nnumerator = valid_subsets\ndenominator = total_subsets - 1\n\n# Simplify the fraction\ncommon_divisor = gcd(numerator, denominator)\nm = numerator // common_divisor\nn = denominator // common_divisor\n\n# Result\nresult = m + n\nprint(result)\n```\n```output\n32778\n```\n",

Each of the 12 unit line segments forming the sides of the squares is colored either red or blue in such a way that each unit square has 2 red sides and 2 blue sides. Find the number of such colorings. \n Answer: To solve this problem, we first need to understand the constraints. Each of the 12 unit line segments (4 horizontal and 4 vertical) must be colored either red or blue, and each of the 4 unit squares must have exactly 2 red sides and 2 blue sides. This means that each unit square must have either a red side and a blue side on its two adjacent sides.\n\nLet's label the squares as follows:\n```\nA B\nC D\n```\nEach square has the following sides:\n- Square A: top, left, right, bottom\n- Square B: top, right, bottom, left\n- Square C: top, left, bottom, right\n- Square D: top, right, bottom, left\n\nTo satisfy the condition that each square has exactly 2 red and 2 blue sides, we can start by coloring the top side of square A red. This forces the left side of square A and the top side of square B to be blue. Continuing this logic, we can determine the colors of the other sides.\n\nLet's use Python to enumerate all possible valid colorings. We'll represent the grid as a list of 12 binary values, where 0 represents blue and 1 represents red. We'll then check the constraints for each possible coloring.\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the constraints for each square\ndef is_valid_coloring(coloring):\n    # Unpack the coloring list\n    A, B, C, D = coloring\n    \n    # Check the constraints for each square\n    # Square A: top, left, right, bottom\n    if (A[0] + A[1] + A[2] + A[3] != 2 or A[0] + A[1] != 2 or A[2] + A[3] != 2):\n        return False\n    # Square B: top, right, bottom, left\n    if (B[0] + B[1] + B[2] + B[3] != 2 or B[0] + B[1] != 2 or B[2] + B[3] != 2):\n        return False\n    # Square C: top, left, bottom, right\n    if (C[0] + C[1] + C[2] + C[3] != 2 or C[0] + C[1] != 2 or C[2] + C[3] != 2):\n        return False\n    # Square D: top, right, bottom, left\n    if (D[0] + D[1] + D[2] + D[3] != 2 or D[0] + D[1] != 2 or D[2] + D[3] != 2):\n        return False\n    return True\n\n# Generate all possible colorings\nall_colorings = itertools.product([0, 1], repeat=12)\n\n# Count the number of valid colorings\nvalid_colorings_count = sum(1 for coloring in all_colorings if is_valid_coloring(coloring))\n\nprint(valid_colorings_count)\n```\n```output\nValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 4)\n```\n",

Find $a+b+c$. \n Answer: To solve this problem, we need to first determine the equation of the parabola after it has been rotated by $60^\\circ$ counterclockwise around the origin. The rotation of a point $(x, y)$ by $60^\\circ$ counterclockwise around the origin gives the point \\((x', y') = \\left(x \\cos(60^\\circ) - y \\sin(60^\\circ), x \\sin(60^\\circ) + y \\cos(60^\\circ)\\right) = \\left(\\frac{x - \\sqrt{3}y}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}x + y}{2}\\right)\\).\n\nGiven the original parabola $y = x^2 - 4$, we need to find the equation of the rotated parabola. We can substitute $x = \\frac{x' + \\sqrt{3}y'}{2}$ and $y = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}x' - y'}{2}$ into the original equation $y = x^2 - 4$ to get the equation of the rotated parabola in terms of $x'$ and $y'$.\n\nLet's perform this substitution and simplify:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}x' - y'}{2} = \\left(\\frac{x' + \\sqrt{3}y'}{2}\\right)^2 - 4\n\\]\nSimplifying the right-hand side:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}x' - y'}{2} = \\frac{(x' + \\sqrt{3}y')^2}{4} - 4\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}x' - y'}{2} = \\frac{x'^2 + 2\\sqrt{3}x'y' + 3y'^2}{4} - 4\n\\]\nMultiplying through by 4 to clear the denominator:\n\\[\n2\\sqrt{3}x' - 2y' = x'^2 + 2\\sqrt{3}x'y' + 3y'^2 - 16\n\\]\nRearranging terms, we get the equation of the rotated parabola:\n\\[\nx'^2 + 2\\sqrt{3}x'y' + 3y'^2 - 2\\sqrt{3}x' + 2y' - 16 = 0\n\\]\nNow we need to find the intersection points of the original parabola $y = x^2 - 4$ and the rotated parabola. We substitute $y = x^2 - 4$ into the equation of the rotated parabola:\n\\[\nx'^2 + 2\\sqrt{3}x'(x^2 - 4) + 3(x^2 - 4)^2 - 2\\sqrt{3}x' + 2(x^2 - 4) - 16 = 0\n\\]\nSimplifying the terms:\n\\[\nx'^2 + 2\\sqrt{3}x^3 - 8\\sqrt{3}x' + 3(x^4 - 8x^2 + 16) - 2\\sqrt{3}x' + 2x^2 - 8 - 16 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\nx'^2 + 2\\sqrt{3}x^3 - 8\\sqrt{3}x' + 3x^4 - 24x^2 + 48 - 2\\sqrt{3}x' + 2x^2 - 24 = 0\n\\]\nCombining like terms:\n\\[\n3x^4 + 2\\sqrt{3}x^3 - 22x^2 - 10\\sqrt{3}x' + x'^2 + 24 = 0\n\\]\nThis is a complicated equation, but we can solve it using numerical methods or by recognizing that the intersection points can be found by solving a simpler equation. To find the $y$-coordinate of the intersection point in the fourth quadrant, we can use the fact that the $y$-coordinate of the intersection point must satisfy both the original parabola and the rotated parabola. We can use the symmetry of the problem and the fact that the $y$-coordinate must be positive to find the correct solution.\n\nBy solving the equation numerically or by recognizing the symmetry, we find that the $y$-coordinate of the intersection point in the fourth quadrant is $\\frac{5 - \\sqrt{17}}{2}$. This gives us $a = 5$, $b = 17$, and $c = 2$.

Since $EFGH$ is inscribed in $\\omega_1$, the distance from the center to any vertex is 6, so $x^2 + y^2 = 36$.\n\n4. **Equal Areas of Triangles:**\n   - The area of $\\triangle DGF$ is equal to the area of $\\triangle CHG$.\n   - Using the coordinates, we can find the areas of these triangles and set them equal to each other.\n\nLet's implement this in Python using sympy to find the area of the rectangle $EFGH$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = sp.symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation of the circle with radius 6 centered at (0, 0)\ncircle_eq = x**2 + y**2 - 36\n\n# Solve for y in terms of x\ny_sol = sp.solve(circle_eq, y)\ny1 = y_sol[0]\ny2 = y_sol[1]\n\n# Area of triangle DGF and CHG\n# DGF: base is 2x and height is y\n# CHG: base is 2x and height is y\n# Since the areas are equal, we can use either one\narea_DGF = (1/2) * 2 * x * y1\narea_CHG = (1/2) * 2 * x * y2\n\n# Set the areas equal and solve for x\narea_eq = sp.Eq(area_DGF, area_CHG)\nx_sol = sp.solve(area_eq, x)\nx_val = x_sol[0]\n\n# Substitute x back into the circle equation to find y\ny_val = y_sol[0].subs(x, x_val)\n\n# Area of the rectangle EFGH is 2x * 2y\narea_rectangle = 2 * x_val * 2 * y_val\n\n# Simplify the area\narea_rectangle_simplified = sp.simplify(area_rectangle)\n\n# Extract m and n from the simplified area\nm, n = sp.fraction(area_rectangle_simplified)\n\n# Result\nresult = m + n\nprint(result)\n```\n```output\nIndexError: list index out of range\n```\nIt seems there was an issue with the code logic, specifically with the handling of the solutions for $x$ and $y$. Let's re-evaluate the steps and correct the approach.\n\n1. **Understand the Geometry:**\n   - Circle $\\omega_1$ with radius 6 and center $A$ is internally tangent to circle $\\omega_2$ with radius 15 at point $B$.\n   - $BC$ is a diameter of $\\omega_2$ and $BC \\perp AD$.\n   - The rectangle $EFGH$ is inscribed in $\\omega_1$ such that $\\overline{EF} \\perp \\overline{BC}$, $C$ is closer to $\\overline{GH}$ than to $\\overline{EF}$, and $D$ is closer to $\\overline{FG}$ than to $\\overline{EH}$.\n   - Triangles $\\triangle DGF$ and $\\triangle CHG$ have equal areas.\n\n2. **Find the Coordinates:**\n   - Place the center $A$ of $\\omega_1$ at $(0, 0)$ and the center of $\\omega_2$ at $(0, 15)$.\n   - The coordinates of $B$ are $(0, 9)$ since it is the point of tangency and $BC$ is a diameter of $\\omega_2$.\n   - The coordinates of $C$ are $(0, 15)$ and $D$ can be found using the fact that $\\overline{BC} \\perp \\overline{AD}$ and the radius of $\\omega_1$ is 6.\n\n3. **Inscribed Rectangle:**\n   - The rectangle $EFGH$ is inscribed in $\\omega_1$ such that $\\overline{EF} \\perp \\overline{BC}$, so $E$ and $H$ lie on $\\omega_1$ and $EF \\parallel BC$.\n   - Let the coordinates of $E$ be $(x, y)$ and $H$ be $(-x, y)$.

Eight people each select a chair in which to sit so that no person sits next to two other people. Let $ N $ be the number of subsets of 16 chairs that could be selected. Find the remainder when $ N $ is divided by 1000. \n Answer: To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to choose 8 chairs out of 16 such that no two chosen chairs are adjacent. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to place 8 non-adjacent people in 16 chairs.\n\nWe can use a combinatorial approach to solve this problem. We need to place 8 people in 16 chairs such that no two people are adjacent. This can be visualized as placing 8 people in 8 \"gaps\" created by the 8 people, with each gap being at least one chair long. This is equivalent to choosing 8 gaps out of the 9 possible gaps (since we need to leave at least one chair between each person).\n\nThe number of ways to choose 8 gaps out of 9 is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{9}{8}\\). However, we need to consider the arrangement of the people in these gaps. Since the people are distinct, we need to multiply by the number of ways to arrange 8 people, which is \\(8!\\).\n\nSo the total number of ways is:\n\\[ N = \\binom{9}{8} \\cdot 8! = 9 \\cdot 8! \\]\n\nLet's calculate this value and find the remainder when it is divided by 1000.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the number of ways to choose 8 gaps out of 9 and arrange 8 people\nN = math.comb(9, 8) * math.factorial(8)\n\n# Find the remainder when N is divided by 1000\nremainder = N % 1000\nprint((N, remainder))\n```\n```output\n(362880, 880)\n```\n",

Find the number of ways to draw 12 segments of equal lengths so that each vertex in $ S $ is an endpoint of exactly one of the 12 segments. \n Answer: To solve this problem, we need to think about how to connect the vertices of a 24-gon in such a way that each vertex is an endpoint of exactly one of the 12 segments. This is equivalent to finding the number of perfect matchings in a cycle graph of 24 vertices. In a cycle graph, each vertex must be connected to exactly one other vertex by a segment, and each segment must have the same length.\n\nThe number of ways to do this is given by the formula for the number of perfect matchings in a cycle graph of \\(2n\\) vertices, which is \\((2n-1)!! = (2n-1) \\times (2n-3) \\times \\cdots \\times 1\\).

This point is known as the Fermat point or geometric median of the set of points. For a convex pentagon with certain properties, the Fermat point can often be found by considering the symmetry and angles of the pentagon.\n\nGiven the angles \\(\\angle B = \\angle E = 60^\\circ\\) and the side lengths, we can use symmetry and geometric properties to find the optimal point \\( X \\). The least possible value of \\( f(X) \\) can be found by considering the sum of distances from \\( X \\) to the vertices of the pentagon.\n\nTo find this value, we can use the fact that the Fermat point minimizes the sum of distances to the vertices of a convex polygon. The exact calculation involves solving a system of equations, but we can use symmetry and known properties of the pentagon to simplify the problem.\n\nGiven the symmetry and the specific angles, we can use the fact that the Fermat point for a pentagon with certain angles and side lengths can often be found by considering the centroid or a specific point derived from the geometry of the pentagon.\n\nFor this specific pentagon, we can use the fact that the least possible value of \\( f(X) \\) can be derived from the properties of the pentagon and the angles.

Find the number of ways to draw 12 segments of equal lengths so that each vertex in $ S $ is an endpoint of exactly one of the 12 segments. \n Answer: To solve the problem, we need to count the number of ways to draw 12 segments of equal lengths from the vertices of a regular 24-gon such that each vertex is an endpoint of exactly one segment. This is equivalent to finding the number of perfect matchings in a 24-vertex cycle graph. \n\nThe number of perfect matchings in a cycle graph with $2n$ vertices is given by the formula:\n\\[ M(2n) = (2n-1)!! = (2n-1) \\cdot (2n-3) \\cdot (2n-5) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot 1 \\]\nwhere $!!$ denotes the double factorial.\n\nFor $24$ vertices, we have $2n = 24$, so $n = 12$.

The number $17_b$ in base 10 is $1 \\cdot b + 7 = b + 7$, and the number $97_b$ in base 10 is $9 \\cdot b + 7 = 9b + 7$. We need to find the integer bases $b > 9$ such that $17_b$ divides $97_b$. This means that $b + 7$ must divide $9b + 7$. We can express this as:\n\\[ 9b + 7 = k(b + 7) \\]\nfor some integer $k$. Rearranging the equation, we get:\n\\[ 9b + 7 = kb + 7k \\]\n\\[ 9b - kb = 7k - 7 \\]\n\\[ b(9 - k) = 7(k - 1) \\]\n\\[ b = \\frac{7(k - 1)}{9 - k} \\]\nSince $b$ must be an integer greater than 9, $7(k - 1)$ must be divisible by $9 - k$ and the resulting $b$ must be greater than 9. We need to find all such $k$ values and corresponding $b$ values. Let's iterate over possible values of $k$ and check the conditions.\n```python\n# We need to find all integer bases b > 9 for which 17_b is a divisor of 97_b.\n# This means b + 7 must divide 9b + 7.\n\ndef find_bases():\n    bases = []\n    for k in range(2, 10):  # k must be in the range 2 to 9 because 9 - k must be a positive integer\n        if (7 * (k - 1)) % (9 - k) == 0:\n            b = 7 * (k - 1) // (9 - k)\n            if b > 9:\n                bases.append(b)\n    return bases\n\n# Find all valid bases and calculate their sum\nbases = find_bases()\nsum_of_bases = sum(bases)\nprint((bases, sum_of_bases))\n```\n```output\nZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero\n```\n",
