They are enumerated in the table below.\n\\begin{tabular}{cc|ccccccccccccccccccc}\n$A$ & $B$ & $b_{0}$ & $b_{1}$ & $b_{2}$ & $b_{3}$ & $b_{4}$ & $b_{5}$ & $b_{6}$ & $b_{7}$ & $b_{8}$ & $b_{9}$ & $b_{10}$ & $b_{11}$ & $b_{12}$ & $b_{13}$ & $b_{14}$ & $b_{15}$ &  \\\\\n\\hline\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 &  \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 &  \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 &  \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 &  \\\\\n\\end{tabular}", "code": ["To determine the number of different possible one-output boolean functions of two variables \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), we need to consider all possible combinations of the inputs \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) and the corresponding outputs \\( C \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the inputs and outputs:**\n   - The inputs are \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), each of which can be either 0 or 1.\n   - The output \\( C \\) can also be either 0 or 1.\n\n2. **List all possible combinations of inputs:**\n   - There are \\( 2 \\) choices for \\( A \\) (0 or 1).\n   - There are \\( 2 \\) choices for \\( B \\) (0 or 1).\n   - Therefore, there are \\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\) possible combinations of inputs:\n     - \\( (A, B) = (0, 0) \\)\n     - \\( (A, B) = (0, 1) \\)\n     - \\( (A, B) = (1, 0) \\)\n     - \\( (A, B) = (1, 1) \\)\n\n3. **Determine the possible outputs for each combination of inputs:**\n   - For each of the 4 input combinations, the output \\( C \\) can be either 0 or 1.\n   - Therefore, for each input combination, there are 2 possible outputs.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of different boolean functions:**\n   - Since there are 4 input combinations and each can have 2 possible outputs, the total number of different boolean functions is:\n     \\[\n     2^4 = 16\n     \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe number of different possible one-output boolean functions of two variables \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) is \\(\\boxed{16}\\)."], "pred": ["16"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}

Combine the solutions to get the general solution.\n\nLet's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Rewrite the equation in a standard form\nThe given equation is:\n\\[x^2 y' + 2xy = \\sin(2x)\\]\nDividing through by \\(x^2\\), we get:\n\\[y' + \\frac{2}{x}y = \\frac{\\sin(2x)}{x^2}\\]\n\n### Step 2: Identify the integrating factor\nThe integrating factor for a first-order linear differential equation \\(y' + p(x)y = q(x)\\) is given by \\(e^{\\int p(x) \\, dx}\\).

We assume a solution of the form \\(y_p = u(x) \\cdot \\frac{1}{x^2}\\), where \\(u(x)\\) is a function to be determined. Substituting \\(y_p\\) into the original differential equation, we get:\n\\[x^2 \\left(\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(u \\cdot \\frac{1}{x^2}\\right)\\right) + 2x \\left(u \\cdot \\frac{1}{x^2}\\right) = \\sin(2x)\\]\nSimplifying the left-hand side, we get:\n\\[x^2 \\left(\\frac{u'}{x^2} - \\frac{2u}{x^3}\\right) + \\frac{2u}{x} = \\sin(2x)\\]\n\\[u' - \\frac{2u}{x} + \\frac{2u}{x} = \\sin(2x)\\]\n\\[u' = \\sin(2x)\\]\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\\[u = -\\frac{1}{2} \\cos(2x) + C\\]\nSo the particular solution is:\n\\[y_p = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\cos(2x) + C\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{x^2} = -\\frac{\\cos(2x)}{2x^2} + \\frac{C}{x^2}\\]\nSince we are looking for a particular solution, we can ignore the constant term \\(C\\), so we have:\n\\[y_p = -\\frac{\\cos(2x)}{2x^2}\\]\n\n### Step 5: Combine the solutions to get the general solution\nThe general solution to the differential equation is the sum of the homogeneous solution and the particular solution:\n\\[y = y_h + y_p = \\frac{C}{x^2} - \\frac{\\cos(2x)}{2x^2} = \\frac{C - \\cos(2x)}{2x^2}\\]\nSo the general solution is:\n\\[y = \\frac{C - \\cos(2x)}{2x^2}\\]\n\nLet's verify this solution using Python and sympy.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variables\nx = sp.symbols('x')\ny = sp.Function('y')(x)\n\n# Define the differential equation\ndifferential_eq = x**2 * sp.diff(y, x) + 2 * x * y - sp.sin(2 * x)\n\n# Solve the differential equation\ngeneral_solution = sp.dsolve(differential_eq, y)\nprint(general_solution)\n```\n```output\nEq(y(x), (C1 - cos(2*x)/2)/x**2)\n```\nThe output from the Python code confirms our manual solution.

To solve it, we can use an integrating factor. The integrating factor for this equation is \\(e^{\\int \\frac{b}{m} dt} = e^{\\frac{b}{m} t}\\). Multiplying both sides of the equation by the integrating factor, we get:\n\\[ m e^{\\frac{b}{m} t} \\frac{dv}{dt} + b e^{\\frac{b}{m} t} v = f e^{\\frac{b}{m} t} \\]\nThe left-hand side of this equation is the derivative of the product \\(m e^{\\frac{b}{m} t} v\\):\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( m e^{\\frac{b}{m} t} v \\right) = f e^{\\frac{b}{m} t} \\]\nIntegrating both sides with respect to \\(t\\), we get:\n\\[ m e^{\\frac{b}{m} t} v = \\int f e^{\\frac{b}{m} t} dt + C \\]\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration. The integral on the right-hand side can be evaluated as:\n\\[ \\int f e^{\\frac{b}{m} t} dt = \\frac{m f}{b} e^{\\frac{b}{m} t} + C_1 \\]\nwhere \\(C_1\\) is another constant of integration. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ m e^{\\frac{b}{m} t} v = \\frac{m f}{b} e^{\\frac{b}{m} t} + C \\]\nDividing both sides by \\(m e^{\\frac{b}{m} t}\\), we get:\n\\[ v = \\frac{f}{b} + C e^{-\\frac{b}{m} t} \\]\nThe constant \\(C\\) can be determined from the initial condition. If the initial velocity \\(v(0) = v_0\\), then:\n\\[ v_0 = \\frac{f}{b} + C \\]\nSo, \\(C = v_0 - \\frac{f}{b}\\).

You will need to use the moment of inertia of a point mass about an axis.  You will also need to use the fact that the torque is the product of the force and the lever arm.  The lever arm is the distance from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is applied.  In this case, the lever arm is the length of the rod, $l$.  The torque is the product of the force and the lever arm, so the torque is $f(t)l$.  The moment of inertia of a point mass about an axis is $ml^2$.  The equation of motion is the product of the moment of inertia and the angular acceleration, which is the second derivative of the angle with respect to time.

In special relativity, the velocity of an object as observed by a moving observer is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula for the velocity of an object as observed by a moving observer is:\n\n\\[ u' = \\frac{u - v}{1 - \\frac{uv}{c^2}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( u \\) is the velocity of the object in the original frame of reference,\n- \\( v \\) is the velocity of the observer in the original frame of reference,\n- \\( u' \\) is the velocity of the object as observed by the moving observer,\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of light.\n\nIn this problem, Manny Relativirez is running towards first base at speed \\( \\beta \\) in the original frame of reference. He sees third base at an angle of \\( 45^\\circ \\) to his left. This means that the velocity of third base relative to Manny is at an angle of \\( 45^\\circ \\) to his left. The velocity of third base in the original frame of reference is \\( c \\) (since it is the speed of light).\n\nLet's denote the velocity of Manny as \\( \\beta \\) and the velocity of third base as \\( c \\). The angle between Manny's velocity and the velocity of third base is \\( 45^\\circ \\). The velocity of third base as observed by Manny is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula. Since the angle is \\( 45^\\circ \\), the components of the velocity of third base in the direction of Manny's motion and perpendicular to his motion are equal.\n\nThe component of the velocity of third base in the direction of Manny's motion is \\( c \\cos(45^\\circ) = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{2}} \\). The component of the velocity of third base perpendicular to Manny's motion is \\( c \\sin(45^\\circ) = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{2}} \\).\n\nThe velocity of third base as observed by Manny is given by:\n\n\\[ u' = \\frac{c - \\beta}{1 - \\frac{c \\beta}{c^2}} = \\frac{c - \\beta}{1 - \\frac{\\beta}{c}} \\]\n\nSince the angle is \\( 45^\\circ \\), the magnitude of the velocity of third base as observed by Manny is \\( \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{2}} \\).

The energy of a photon can also be expressed in terms of its wavelength $\\lambda$ as:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} \\]\n\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light ($3.00 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}$). By equating these two expressions for the energy of the photon, we can solve for the wavelength $\\lambda$:\n\n\\[ h \\nu = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} \\]\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{c}{\\nu} \\]\n\nGiven the frequency $\\nu = 3.091 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{Hz}$, we can substitute the values of $c$ and $\\nu$ into the equation to find the wavelength $\\lambda$.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python.\n```python\n# Given values\nfrequency = 3.091 * 10**14  # Hz\nspeed_of_light = 3.00 * 10**8  # m/s\n\n# Calculate the wavelength\nwavelength = speed_of_light / frequency\nprint(wavelength)\n```\n```output\n9.699001661421321e-07\n```\nThe calculated wavelength is approximately $9.70 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m}$.

The bond energy is given as \\(3.84 \\text{ eV}\\), and the repulsive exponent is 8. The formula for the potential energy \\(U\\) between two ions with charges \\(q_1\\) and \\(q_2\\) separated by a distance \\(r\\) is given by:\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{k q_1 q_2}{r^8} \\]\n\nwhere \\(k\\) is a constant. At equilibrium, the potential energy is minimized, which means the derivative of \\(U\\) with respect to \\(r\\) is zero. However, we can use the fact that the bond energy is the negative of the potential energy at equilibrium. Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\[ U_{\\text{eq}} = -3.84 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nWe need to convert the bond energy from electron-volts to joules. Since \\(1 \\text{ eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}\\), we have:\n\n\\[ U_{\\text{eq}} = -3.84 \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J} = -6.15408 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J} \\]\n\nNow, we substitute the values into the potential energy formula and solve for \\(r\\):\n\n\\[ -6.15408 \\times 10^{-19} = \\frac{k q_1 q_2}{r^8} \\]\n\nThe charges of the sodium and chlorine ions are \\(q_1 = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ C}\\) and \\(q_2 = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ C}\\), respectively. The Coulomb constant \\(k\\) is \\(8.99 \\times 10^9 \\text{ N m}^2/\\text{C}^2\\). Substituting these values in, we get:\n\n\\[ -6.15408 \\times 10^{-19} = \\frac{8.99 \\times 10^9 \\times (1.602 \\times 10^{-19})^2}{r^8} \\]\n\nSimplifying the right-hand side, we have:\n\n\\[ -6.15408 \\times 10^{-19} = \\frac{8.99 \\times 10^9 \\times 2.566404 \\times 10^{-38}}{r^8} = \\frac{2.30727 \\times 10^{-28}}{r^8} \\]\n\nRearranging to solve for \\(r^8\\), we get:\n\n\\[ r^8 = \\frac{2.30727 \\times 10^{-28}}{-6.15408 \\times 10^{-19}} = 3.75 \\times 10^{-10} \\]\n\nTaking the eighth root of both sides, we get:\n\n\\[ r = (3.75 \\times 10^{-10})^{1/8} = 1.08 \\times 10^{-1} \\text{ m} \\]\n\nTherefore, the inter-ionic equilibrium distance is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.1 \\times 10^{-10}} \\]"], "pred": ["1.1\\times10^{-10}"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Calculate the volume of a single gold atom.\n2. Calculate the volume of the unit cell of gold.\n3. Determine the number of gold atoms in the unit cell.\n4. Calculate the total volume of the gold atoms in the unit cell.\n5. Calculate the total void volume by subtracting the volume of the gold atoms from the volume of the unit cell.\n\nLet's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Volume of a single gold atom**: The radius of a gold atom is approximately $1.44 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ cm}$. The volume of a sphere is given by $V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3$.\n2. **Volume of the unit cell**: The unit cell of gold is a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure. The edge length of the unit cell can be calculated using the atomic radius. For an FCC structure, the edge length $a$ is related to the atomic radius $r$ by $a = 2\\sqrt{2}r$. The volume of the unit cell is then $a^3$.\n3. **Number of gold atoms in the unit cell**: In an FCC structure, there are 4 gold atoms per unit cell.\n4. **Total volume of the gold atoms in the unit cell**: This is the number of gold atoms in the unit cell multiplied by the volume of a single gold atom.\n5. **Total void volume**: This is the volume of the unit cell minus the total volume of the gold atoms.\n\nLet's implement this in Python using sympy:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Given values\nr = 1.44e-8  # radius of gold atom in cm\nmolar_volume = 10.3  # molar volume of gold in cm^3/mol\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the volume of a single gold atom\nvolume_atom = (4/3) * sp.pi * r**3\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the volume of the unit cell\na = 2 * sp.sqrt(2) * r  # edge length of the unit cell\nvolume_unit_cell = a**3\n\n# Step 3: Number of gold atoms in the unit cell (FCC structure)\nnum_atoms_per_unit_cell = 4\n\n# Step 4: Total volume of the gold atoms in the unit cell\ntotal_volume_atoms = num_atoms_per_unit_cell * volume_atom\n\n# Step 5: Total void volume\ntotal_void_volume = volume_unit_cell - total_volume_atoms\n\n# Convert the total void volume to cm^3/mol\ntotal_void_volume_per_mole = total_void_volume * molar_volume\n\n# Round the result to 2 decimal places\ntotal_void_volume_per_mole_rounded = round(total_void_volume_per_mole.evalf(), 2)\n\nprint(total_void_volume_per_mole_rounded)\n```\n```output\n0.00\n```\nIt seems that the output is zero, which suggests that the hard-sphere approximation might not be accurate enough for the given radius of the gold atom. Let's re-evaluate the problem and ensure that we are using the correct values and formulas.\n\nThe hard-sphere approximation assumes that the gold atoms are perfect spheres and do not overlap. However, in reality, gold atoms do overlap slightly due to the crystal structure. The actual void volume should be calculated using the actual atomic radius and the crystal structure.\n\nLet's re-calculate the void volume using the actual atomic radius and the crystal structure.

Solving for \\(P\\), we get \\(P = 2\\). Substituting \\(P = 2\\) into either the demand or supply function, we get \\(Q = 2\\). So, the autarkic equilibrium price is $2 per bushel and the autarkic equilibrium quantity is 2 bushels.\n\n2. **Determine the free trade equilibrium price and quantity:**\n   - The world price of barley is $1 per bushel.\n   - Since the world price is lower than the autarkic price, Moldavia will import barley.\n   - The free trade equilibrium price is the world price, which is $1 per bushel.\n   - To find the free trade equilibrium quantity, we need to determine the quantity demanded and supplied at the world price of $1.\n   - The quantity demanded at $1 is \\(Q^D = 4 - 1 = 3\\) bushels.\n   - The quantity supplied at $1 is \\(Q^S = 1\\) bushel.\n   - Since the quantity demanded (3 bushels) is greater than the quantity supplied (1 bushel), Moldavia will import the difference, which is \\(3 - 1 = 2\\) bushels.\n   - Therefore, the free trade equilibrium quantity is 3 bushels (2 bushels demanded + 1 bushel supplied).\n\nLet's summarize the results:\n\n- The free trade equilibrium price of barley in Moldavia is \\(\\boxed{1}\\) dollar per bushel.\n- The free trade equilibrium quantity of barley in Moldavia is \\(\\boxed{3}\\) bushels.\n\nHere is the Python code to verify these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Define the demand and supply functions\ndef demand(P):\n    return 4 - P\n\ndef supply(P):\n    return P\n\n# Autarkic equilibrium\nP_autarkic = 2\nQ_autarkic = demand(P_autarkic)\n\n# Free trade equilibrium\nP_free_trade = 1\nQ_free_trade_demand = demand(P_free_trade)\nQ_free_trade_supply = supply(P_free_trade)\nQ_free_trade = Q_free_trade_demand  # Since Q_free_trade_demand > Q_free_trade_supply, Q_free_trade = Q_free_trade_demand\n\nprint(f\"Free trade equilibrium price: {P_free_trade} dollars per bushel\")\nprint(f\"Free trade equilibrium quantity: {Q_free_trade} bushels\")\n```"], "pred": ["3"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}

When apples cost 75 cents per apple, the residents of Cambridge buy 150 apples in a day.\n\nAssume that the city of Cambridge sets the price of apples within its borders. What price should it set, in cents?​\n\nAssistant: To determine the optimal price for apples in Cambridge, we need to consider the marginal costs and the demand for apples. The orchard has a constant marginal cost of 25 cents per apple, and the store has a constant marginal cost of 75 cents per apple. The residents of Cambridge buy 150 apples in a day when apples cost 75 cents per apple.\n\nLet's denote the price of apples in Cambridge as \\( P \\) cents.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the demand curve:**\n   - When \\( P = 75 \\) cents, the quantity demanded is 150 apples.\n   - The store can supply any remaining apples demanded at a marginal cost of 75 cents per apple.\n   - The orchard can produce up to 50 apples per day at a marginal cost of 25 cents per apple.\n\n2. **Determine the quantity supplied by the orchard:**\n   - If the price \\( P \\) is less than 75 cents, the orchard will produce up to its capacity of 50 apples.\n   - If the price \\( P \\) is greater than 75 cents, the orchard will produce 0 apples.\n\n3. **Determine the quantity supplied by the store:**\n   - If the price \\( P \\) is less than 75 cents, the store will supply the remaining quantity demanded.\n   - If the price \\( P \\) is greater than 75 cents, the store will supply 0 apples.\n\n4. **Calculate the total quantity supplied:**\n   - If \\( P \\leq 75 \\) cents, the total quantity supplied is the sum of the quantity supplied by the orchard and the store.\n   - If \\( P > 75 \\) cents, the total quantity supplied is the quantity supplied by the orchard.\n\n5. **Set up the demand equation:**\n   - The demand curve is linear and can be expressed as \\( Q = 150 - \\frac{P - 75}{75} \\times 150 \\).\n   - Simplify the equation: \\( Q = 150 - 2(P - 75) \\).\n   - Further simplify: \\( Q = 150 - 2P + 150 \\).\n   - Final demand equation: \\( Q = 300 - 2P \\).\n\n6. **Determine the optimal price:**\n   - The optimal price is where the marginal cost of the last apple produced equals the marginal benefit (price).\n   - The marginal cost of the last apple produced is the sum of the marginal costs of the orchard and the store.\n   - If \\( P \\leq 75 \\) cents, the marginal cost is \\( 25 + 75 = 100 \\) cents.\n   - If \\( P > 75 \\) cents, the marginal cost is \\( 25 \\) cents.\n\n7. **Set the marginal cost equal to the price:**\n   - For \\( P \\leq 75 \\) cents: \\( 100 = P \\).\n   - For \\( P > 75 \\) cents: \\( 25 = P \\).\n\n8. **Check the feasible price:**\n   - The price \\( P = 100 \\) cents is not feasible because it exceeds the maximum price the store can charge.\n   - The price \\( P = 25 \\) cents is feasible because it is within the range of the store's marginal cost.\n\nTherefore, the optimal price for apples in Cambridge is \\(\\boxed{25}\\) cents."], "pred": ["25"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}
