When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: Find the sum of all integer bases $b>9$ for which $17_{b}$ is a divisor of $97_{b}$.\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nTo",

Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\).

He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm.

Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality.

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: Let $ S $ be the set of vertices of a regular 24-gon.

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: The 9 members of a baseball team went to an ice cream parlor after their game.

Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\).

For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nTo",

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: Circle $\\omega_1$ with radius 6 centered at point $A$ is internally tangent at point $B$ to circle $\\omega_2$ with radius 15.

He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nTo",

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: Sixteen chairs are arranged in a row.

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: On $\\triangle ABC$ points $A,D,E$, and $B$ lie that order on side $\\overline{AB}$ with $AD=4, DE=16$, and $EB=8$.

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: Six points $ A, B, C, D, E, $ and $ F $ lie in a straight line in that order.

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: From an unlimited supply of 1-cent coins, 10-cent coins, and 25-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $ N $ cents, where $ N $ is a positive integer. He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nTo",

Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: Alex divides a disk into four quadrants with two perpendicular diameters intersecting at the center of the disk.

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\).

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: A piecewise linear periodic function is defined by $f(x)=\\begin{cases}x&\\text{if }x\\in[-1,1)\\\\2-x&\\text{if }x\\in[1,3)\\end{cases}$ and $f(x+4)=f(x)$ for all real numbers $x$.

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: Four unit squares form a $2 \\times 2$ grid.

He draws 25 more line segments through the disk, drawing each segment by selecting two points at random on the perimeter of the disk in different quadrants and connecting those two points. Find the expected number of regions into which these 27 line segments divide the disk.\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand how the number of regions in a disk increases as we add more line segments. When we start with no line segments, the disk is divided into 1 region. Each new line segment added can potentially increase the number of regions by the number of regions it intersects plus one. \n\nThe formula for the maximum number of regions \\( R(n) \\) that \\( n \\) line segments can divide a disk into is given by:\n\n\\[ R(n) = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} + 1 \\]\n\nThis formula comes from the fact that each new line segment can intersect all the previous line segments, creating new regions. For \\( n = 25 \\) new line segments added to the initial segment, the total number of line segments is 26. Plugging \\( n = 26 \\) into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[ R(26) = \\frac{26 \\cdot 27}{2} + 1 = \\frac{702}{2} + 1 = 351 + 1 = 352 \\]\n\nSo the expected number of regions into which these 27 line segments divide the disk is 352. Let's confirm this with Python code.\n```python\n# Calculate the number of regions using the formula\r\ndef number_of_regions(n):\r\n    return (n * (n + 1)) // 2 + 1\r\n\r\n# Number of line segments added to the initial segment\r\nn = 26\r\n\r\n# Calculate the number of regions\r\nregions = number_of_regions(n)\r\nprint(regions)\n```\n```output\n352\n```\n",

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: Find the sum of all positive integers $ n $ such that $ n + 2 $ divides the product $ 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) $.\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nTo find the sum of all positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n + 2 \\) divides the product \\( 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\), we need to analyze the divisibility condition. Let's denote \\( d = n + 2 \\). Then \\( n = d - 2 \\). We need to check when \\( d \\) divides \\( 3(d + 1)((d - 2)^2 + 9) \\).\n\nFirst, let's simplify the expression inside the parentheses:\n\\[ (d - 2)^2 + 9 = d^2 - 4d + 4 + 9 = d^2 - 4d + 13. \\]\nSo the expression we need to check is:\n\\[ 3(d + 1)(d^2 - 4d + 13). \\]\nWe need \\( d \\) to divide this expression. Since \\( d \\) divides \\( d^2 - 4d + 13 \\) (because \\( d^2 - 4d + 13 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{d} \\)), we need \\( d \\) to divide \\( 3(d + 1) \\). This means \\( d \\) must divide \\( 3(d + 1) \\), which simplifies to checking when \\( d \\) divides \\( 3d + 3 \\). Since \\( d \\) always divides \\( 3d \\), we need \\( d \\) to divide 3. The divisors of 3 are 1 and 3.\n\nSo \\( d \\) can be 1 or 3. Let's check each case:\n\n1. If \\( d = 1 \\), then \\( n = 1 - 2 = -1 \\), which is not a positive integer.\n2. If \\( d = 3 \\), then \\( n = 3 - 2 = 1 \\).\n\nSo the only positive integer \\( n \\) that satisfies the condition is \\( n = 1 \\). The sum of all such positive integers is simply 1.\n\nLet's verify this with Python code to ensure accuracy.\n```python\n# Function to check if n+2 divides 3*(n+3)*(n^2 + 9)\ndef check_divisibility(n):\n    d = n + 2\n    product = 3 * (n + 3) * (n**2 + 9)\n    return product % d == 0\n\n# Find all positive integers n such that n+2 divides 3*(n+3)*(n^2 + 9)\npositive_integers = []\nfor n in range(1, 100):  # We can check for a reasonable range of n\n    if check_divisibility(n):\n        positive_integers.append(n)\n\n# Sum of all such positive integers\nsum_of_positive_integers = sum(positive_integers)\nprint((positive_integers, sum_of_positive_integers))\n```\n```output\n([1, 11, 37], 49)\n```\n"
