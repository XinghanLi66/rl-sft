When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: Find the sum of all integer bases $b>9$ for which $17_{b}$ is a divisor of $97_{b}$.\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nTo",

Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\).

He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm.

Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality.

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: Let $ S $ be the set of vertices of a regular 24-gon.

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: The 9 members of a baseball team went to an ice cream parlor after their game.

Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\).

For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nTo",

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: Circle $\\omega_1$ with radius 6 centered at point $A$ is internally tangent at point $B$ to circle $\\omega_2$ with radius 15.

He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nTo",

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: Sixteen chairs are arranged in a row.

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: On $\\triangle ABC$ points $A,D,E$, and $B$ lie that order on side $\\overline{AB}$ with $AD=4, DE=16$, and $EB=8$.

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: Six points $ A, B, C, D, E, $ and $ F $ lie in a straight line in that order.

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: From an unlimited supply of 1-cent coins, 10-cent coins, and 25-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $ N $ cents, where $ N $ is a positive integer. He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nTo",

Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: Alex divides a disk into four quadrants with two perpendicular diameters intersecting at the center of the disk.

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\).

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: A piecewise linear periodic function is defined by $f(x)=\\begin{cases}x&\\text{if }x\\in[-1,1)\\\\2-x&\\text{if }x\\in[1,3)\\end{cases}$ and $f(x+4)=f(x)$ for all real numbers $x$.

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: Four unit squares form a $2 \\times 2$ grid.

Eight people each select a chair in which to sit so that no person sits next to two other people. Let $ N $ be the number of subsets of 16 chairs that could be selected. Find the remainder when $ N $ is divided by 1000.\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose 8 chairs out of 16 such that no two chosen chairs are adjacent. This is a combinatorial problem that can be solved using the concept of \"gaps\" between chosen chairs.\n\nLet's denote the chosen chairs as \\(C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_8\\). To ensure that no two chosen chairs are adjacent, we need to place at least one empty chair between each pair of chosen chairs. We can think of this as placing 8 chosen chairs and 7 gaps (one between each pair of chosen chairs) in a row of 16 chairs. This leaves us with \\(16 - 8 - 7 = 1\\) extra chair that can be placed in any of the 9 positions (before the first chosen chair, between any two chosen chairs, or after the last chosen chair).\n\nThis problem is equivalent to choosing 8 positions out of 9 possible positions (the 7 gaps plus the two ends). The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{9}{8}\\).\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the total number of ways to choose 8 chairs out of 16 without any restrictions. This is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{16}{8}\\). But since we are only interested in the subsets where no two chosen chairs are adjacent, we need to subtract the number of ways where at least one pair of chosen chairs are adjacent.\n\nTo find the number of valid subsets, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. But for simplicity, we can directly calculate the number of valid subsets using the combinatorial method described above.\n\nLet's calculate \\(\\binom{9}{8}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{9}{8} = 9\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of subsets of 16 chairs that could be selected such that no person sits next to two other people is 9. The remainder when 9 is divided by 1000 is simply 9.\n\nLet's confirm this with Python code.\n```python\n# Calculate the number of valid subsets\nfrom math import comb\n\n# Number of ways to choose 8 chairs out of 16 such that no two are adjacent\nvalid_subsets = comb(9, 8)\n\n# Remainder when divided by 1000\nremainder = valid_subsets % 1000\nprint(remainder)\n```\n```output\n9\n```\n",
