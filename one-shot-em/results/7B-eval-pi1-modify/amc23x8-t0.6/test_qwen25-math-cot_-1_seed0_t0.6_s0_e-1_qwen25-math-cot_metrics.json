When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To determine the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds, we start by expressing the relationship between pressure \\( P \\), area \\( A \\), and velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: Cities $A$ and $B$ are $45$ miles apart.
