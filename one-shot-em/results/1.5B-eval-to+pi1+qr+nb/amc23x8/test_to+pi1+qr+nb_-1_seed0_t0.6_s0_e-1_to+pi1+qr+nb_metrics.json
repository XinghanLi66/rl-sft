Alicia bikes towards $B$ at 18 miles per hour. Leaving at the same time, Beth bikes toward $A$ at 12 miles per hour. How many miles from City $A$ will they be when they meet? \n Answer: To solve this problem, we need to determine the point where Alicia and Beth meet. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n1. Calculate the total speed at which Alicia and Beth are approaching each other.\n2. Determine the time it takes for them to meet.\n3. Calculate the distance Alicia covers in that time.\n\nThe total speed at which Alicia and Beth are approaching each other is the sum of their individual speeds:\n\\[ \\text{Total speed} = 18 \\text{ mph} + 12 \\text{ mph} = 30 \\text{ mph} \\]\n\nThe time it takes for them to meet is the total distance divided by their combined speed:\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{45 \\text{ miles}}{30 \\text{ mph}} = 1.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThe distance Alicia covers in 1.5 hours is:\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = 18 \\text{ mph} \\times 1.5 \\text{ hours} = 27 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nSo, they will meet 27 miles from City $A$. Let's confirm this with Python code.\n```python\n# Define the variables\ndistance_between_cities = 45  # miles\nspeed_alicia = 18  # miles per hour\nspeed_beth = 12  # miles per hour\n\n# Calculate the total speed\ntotal_speed = speed_alicia + speed_beth  # miles per hour\n\n# Calculate the time it takes for them to meet\ntime_to_meet = distance_between_cities / total_speed  # hours\n\n# Calculate the distance Alicia covers in that time\ndistance_alicia_covers = speed_alicia * time_to_meet  # miles\n\nprint(distance_alicia_covers)\n```\n```output\n27.0\n```\n",

The maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$ can be written in the form $\\tfrac{\\sqrt{m}}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$? \n Answer: To solve the problem, we start by representing the complex number $z$ in the form $z = x + yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, and $i$ is the imaginary unit. The given equation is $|1 + z + z^2| = 4$. Substituting $z = x + yi$, we get:\n\\[ |1 + (x + yi) + (x + yi)^2| = 4 \\]\n\\[ |1 + x + yi + (x^2 + 2xyi - y^2)| = 4 \\]\n\\[ |(1 + x + x^2 - y^2) + (y + 2xy)i| = 4 \\]\nThe magnitude of a complex number $a + bi$ is given by $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. So we have:\n\\[ \\sqrt{(1 + x + x^2 - y^2)^2 + (y + 2xy)^2} = 4 \\]\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\\[ (1 + x + x^2 - y^2)^2 + (y + 2xy)^2 = 16 \\]\nThis is a complex equation, and to find the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$, we need to find the maximum value of $y$ that satisfies this equation.

The possible sets of roots are the permutations of \\((1, 2, -3)\\), \\((-1, -2, 3)\\), and \\((1, -2, -3)\\). Let's enumerate these and find the corresponding values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n1.

Suppose $x$ is the value in cents of the most expensive item in Coinland that cannot be purchased using these coins with exact change. What is the sum of the digits of $x?$ \n Answer: To solve this, we need to find the largest value that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of $6, 10,$ and $15$ cents. This is a classic problem related to the Frobenius coin problem for three coin denominations.\n\nThe Frobenius number for three coin denominations $a, b,$ and $c$ is not straightforward to compute, but we can use a computational approach to find the answer. We'll check all possible sums of $6, 10,$ and $15$ up to a reasonable limit and identify the largest value that cannot be expressed in this form.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find this value.\n```python\ndef can_be_expressed(n, coins):\n    \"\"\"Check if n can be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of coins.\"\"\"\n    for i in range(n // coins[0] + 1):\n        for j in range(n // coins[1] + 1):\n            for k in range(n // coins[2] + 1):\n                if i * coins[0] + j * coins[1] + k * coins[2] == n:\n                    return True\n    return False\n\n# Define the coin values\ncoins = [6, 10, 15]\n\n# Find the largest value that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of the coins\nlimit = 100  # We can set a reasonable limit to search for the answer\nmax_non_expressible = -1\n\nfor n in range(1, limit + 1):\n    if not can_be_expressed(n, coins):\n        max_non_expressible = n\n\n# Sum of the digits of max_non_expressible\nsum_of_digits = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(max_non_expressible))\n\nprint((max_non_expressible, sum_of_digits))\n```\n```output\n(29, 11)\n```\n",

What is the original (before discount) price of the most expensive shoes he could afford to buy? \n Answer: To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final amount Carlos has, taking into account the sales tax and the discount. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Let \\( P \\) be the original price of the shoes.\n2. After a 20% discount, the price becomes \\( 0.8P \\).\n3.

Jackson has enough paint to make a strip $25$ meters long. How many square centimeters of paper could Jackson cover with paint? \n Answer: To find out how many square centimeters of paper Jackson could cover with paint, we need to calculate the area of the strip. The area \\( A \\) of a rectangle is given by the product of its width and length. Here, the width is \\( 6.5 \\) millimeters and the length is \\( 25 \\) meters. First, we need to convert the length from meters to millimeters (since \\( 1 \\) meter \\( = 1000 \\) millimeters), and then convert the area from square millimeters to square centimeters (since \\( 1 \\) square meter \\( = 10000 \\) square millimeters and \\( 1 \\) square centimeter \\( = 100 \\) square millimeters).\n\nLet's perform the calculations step-by-step:\n1.

The maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$ can be written in the form $\\tfrac{\\sqrt{m}}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$? \n Answer: To solve the problem, we start by expressing the complex number $z$ in terms of its real and imaginary parts. Let $z = x + yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers. Then,\n\\[ 1 + z + z^2 = 1 + (x + yi) + (x + yi)^2 = 1 + x + yi + x^2 + 2xyi - y^2 = (1 + x + x^2 - y^2) + (y + 2xy)i \\]\nThe magnitude of this complex number is given by\n\\[ |1 + z + z^2| = \\sqrt{(1 + x + x^2 - y^2)^2 + (y + 2xy)^2} = 4 \\]\nSquaring both sides, we get\n\\[ (1 + x + x^2 - y^2)^2 + (y + 2xy)^2 = 16 \\]\nThis equation represents the set of points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given condition. To find the maximum value of the imaginary part $y$, we need to maximize $y$ while satisfying this equation. We can use calculus or numerical methods to find the maximum value of $y$.\n\nLet's use Python to find the maximum value of $y$.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\n# Define the function that represents the constraint\ndef constraint(y, x):\n    return (1 + x + x**2 - y**2)**2 + (y + 2*x*y)**2 - 16\n\n# Define the function to maximize y\ndef objective(y):\n    return -y  # We use negative y because we will use a minimization function\n\n# Initial guess for x and y\nx0 = [0, 1]\n\n# Define the constraint in the form required by scipy.optimize.minimize\ncons = ({'type': 'eq', 'fun': lambda y, x: constraint(y, x)})\n\n# Perform the optimization\nresult = minimize(objective, x0, constraints=cons, bounds=[(-10, 10), (-10, 10)])\n\n# Extract the maximum value of y\nmax_y = -result.fun\nprint(max_y)\n```\n```output\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'scipy'\n```\n",

Suppose $x$ is the value in cents of the most expensive item in Coinland that cannot be purchased using these coins with exact change. What is the sum of the digits of $x?$ \n Answer: To solve the problem, we need to find the largest value that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of 6, 10, and 15. This is a variation of the Frobenius coin problem, but with three coin values. We can use a brute-force approach to check each value starting from 1 until we find the largest value that cannot be expressed as a combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n\nLet's write a Python code to find this value and then compute the sum of its digits.\n```python\ndef can_be_expressed(n, coins):\n    \"\"\"Check if n can be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of the given coins.\"\"\"\n    for i in range(n // coins[0] + 1):\n        for j in range(n // coins[1] + 1):\n            for k in range(n // coins[2] + 1):\n                if i * coins[0] + j * coins[1] + k * coins[2] == n:\n                    return True\n    return False\n\ncoins = [6, 10, 15]\nmax_value = 100  # We can start with a reasonably large number and adjust if needed\nmost_expensive_value = None\n\nfor value in range(1, max_value + 1):\n    if not can_be_expressed(value, coins):\n        most_expensive_value = value\n\n# Now we need to find the sum of the digits of the most expensive value\nsum_of_digits = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(most_expensive_value))\nprint((most_expensive_value, sum_of_digits))\n```\n```output\n(29, 11)\n```\n",

What is the original (before discount) price of the most expensive shoes he could afford to buy? \n Answer: To find the original price of the most expensive shoes Carlos could buy, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the discounted price of the shoes after the 20% reduction.\n2. Add the 7.5% sales tax to the discounted price to get the final price.\n3. Determine the maximum original price of the shoes that Carlos can afford with $43.\nLet's denote the original price of the shoes as \\( P \\). After a 20% reduction, the price becomes \\( 0.8P \\). After adding the 7.5% sales tax, the final price becomes \\( 0.8P \\times 1.075 \\).

What is $m+n$? \n Answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the imaginary part of a complex number $z$ that satisfies the equation $|1+z+z^2|=4$. Let's represent $z$ as $x + yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.

Jackson has enough paint to make a strip $25$ meters long. How many square centimeters of paper could Jackson cover with paint? \n Answer: To find the area of the paper that Jackson could cover, we need to calculate the area of the strip he makes. The width of the strip is $6.5$ millimeters, which we need to convert to centimeters. Since $1$ centimeter is equal to $10$ millimeters, $6.5$ millimeters is equal to $\\frac{6.5}{10} = 0.65$ centimeters. The length of the strip is $25$ meters, which we need to convert to centimeters. Since $1$ meter is equal to $100$ centimeters, $25$ meters is equal to $25 \\times 100 = 2500$ centimeters. The area of the strip is then the width times the length, which is $0.65 \\times 2500$ square centimeters.\nLet's calculate this using Python.\n```python\n# Define the width of the strip in centimeters\nwidth_cm = 6.5 / 10  # 6.5 millimeters is 0.65 centimeters\n\n# Define the length of the strip in centimeters\nlength_cm = 25 * 100  # 25 meters is 2500 centimeters\n\n# Calculate the area of the strip in square centimeters\narea_cm2 = width_cm * length_cm\nprint(area_cm2)\n```\n```output\n1625.0\n```\n",

A \"turn\" consists of you guessing a square, after which you are told whether that square is covered by the hidden rectangle. What is the minimum number of turns you need to ensure that at least one of your guessed squares is covered by the rectangle? \n Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum number of guesses required to ensure that at least one of the guessed squares is covered by the hidden $2 \\times 1$ rectangle. \n\nFirst, let's consider the grid. There are 9 squares in a $3 \\times 3$ grid. The rectangle can be placed in two orientations: horizontally or vertically. \n\nIf we guess each square one by one, in the worst-case scenario, we would need to guess all 9 squares before finding one that is covered by the rectangle. However, we can use a more strategic approach to minimize the number of guesses.\n\nHere's a strategy:\n1. Guess the center square (5th square).\n2. If the center square is covered, we are done.\n3. If the center square is not covered, we need to consider the remaining 8 squares. The rectangle can be placed in such a way that it covers two adjacent squares in one of the four directions (up, down, left, right). Since we have already guessed the center square, we need to guess at most 4 more squares to cover the remaining possibilities.\n\nSo, in the worst-case scenario, we would need to guess 5 squares (the center square plus 4 more squares in the worst-case scenario).\n\nLet's verify this with Python code to ensure the correctness of our reasoning.\n```python\n# Let's simulate the worst-case scenario where we need to guess all squares except one\n# First guess the center square\ncenter_square = 5  # Index of the center square in a 3x3 grid (1-indexed)\n\n# If the center square is covered, we are done\nif center_square in covered_squares:\n    min_guesses = 1\nelse:\n    # Otherwise, we need to guess the remaining squares\n    # The worst-case scenario is that we need to guess 4 more squares\n    min_guesses = 5\n\nprint(min_guesses)\n```\n```output\nNameError: name 'covered_squares' is not defined\n```\n",

To do this, we can express $y$ in terms of $x$ and then find the critical points. Let's use Python to solve this equation and find the maximum value of $y$.\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\r\n\r\n# Define the variables\r\nx, y = sp.symbols('x y', real=True)\r\n\r\n# Define the equation\r\nequation = (1 + x + x**2 - y**2)**2 + (y + 2*x*y)**2 - 16\r\n\r\n# Solve the equation for y in terms of x\r\nsolutions = sp.solve(equation, y)\r\n\r\n# Find the maximum value of y\r\nmax_y = -sp.oo\r\nfor sol in solutions:\r\n    # Find the critical points by differentiating and setting to zero\r\n    critical_points = sp.solve(sp.diff(sol, x), x)\r\n    for point in critical_points:\r\n        y_val = sol.subs(x, point)\r\n        if y_val.is_real and y_val > max_y:\r\n            max_y = y_val\r\n\r\nprint(max_y)\n```\n```output\nsqrt(19)/2\n```\n",

Alicia bikes towards $B$ at 18 miles per hour. Leaving at the same time, Beth bikes toward $A$ at 12 miles per hour. How many miles from City $A$ will they be when they meet? \n Answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet. Since they are biking towards each other, their combined speed is the sum of their individual speeds: \\(18 + 12 = 30\\) miles per hour. The total distance between them is 45 miles.

A $2 \\times 1$ rectangle covers two adjacent squares (oriented either horizontally or vertically) of a $3 \\times 3$ grid of squares, but you are not told which two squares are covered. Your goal is to find at least one square that is covered by the rectangle. A \"turn\" consists of you guessing a square, after which you are told whether that square is covered by the hidden rectangle. What is the minimum number of turns you need to ensure that at least one of your guessed squares is covered by the rectangle? \n Answer: To solve the problem, let's first analyze the possible configurations of the $2 \\times 1$ rectangle on a $3 \\times 3$ grid. There are 8 possible orientations for the rectangle (2 horizontal and 2 vertical for each of the 3 rows and 3 columns):\n1. Top row, left to right\n2. Top row, right to left\n3. Middle row, left to right\n4. Middle row, right to left\n5. Bottom row, left to right\n6. Bottom row, right to left\n7. Left column, top to bottom\n8. Left column, bottom to top\n9. Right column, top to bottom\n10. Right column, bottom to top\n\nSince the rectangle covers two adjacent squares, let's list the possible pairs of squares that can form the rectangle. For each orientation, we can list the pairs:\n1. Top row: (1,2), (2,3)\n2. Middle row: (1,2), (2,3)\n3. Bottom row: (1,2), (2,3)\n4. Left column: (1,2), (2,3)\n5. Middle column: (1,2), (2,3)\n6. Right column: (1,2), (2,3)\n7. Top left to bottom right: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)\n8. Top right to bottom left: (1,3), (2,2), (3,1)\n9. Left to right: (1,2), (2,3)\n10. Right to left: (1,2), (2,3)\n\nWe can see that there are 12 unique pairs of squares that can form the rectangle. The goal is to find at least one square that is covered by the rectangle. The strategy is to guess the squares in such a way that we cover all possible pairs with the minimum number of guesses.\n\nThe minimum number of turns needed to ensure that at least one of your guessed squares is covered by the rectangle is 4. This is because we can guess the squares in the following order: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). This covers all possible pairs of squares that can form the rectangle.\n\nLet's write the Python code to confirm this reasoning.\n```python\n# Define the possible pairs of squares that can form the rectangle\npossible_pairs = [\n    [(1, 2), (2, 3)],\n    [(1, 2), (2, 3)],\n    [(1, 2), (2, 3)],\n    [(1, 2), (2, 3)],\n    [(1, 2), (2, 3)],\n    [(1, 2), (2, 3)],\n    [(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)],\n    [(1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)],\n    [(1, 2), (2, 3)],\n    [(1, 2), (2, 3)]\n]\n\n# Define the strategy to guess the squares\nguesses = [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)]\n\n# Check if all possible pairs are covered by the guesses\ncovered_pairs = set()\nfor guess in guesses:\n    covered_pairs.update(guess)\n\n# Check if all possible pairs are covered\nall_pairs_covered = all(any(pair in covered_pairs for pair in pairs) for pairs in possible_pairs)\nprint(all_pairs_covered)\n```\n```output\nFalse\n```\n",

The number \\(10^{15}\\) is a 1 followed by 15 zeros, so it has 16 digits. Multiplying by 243 will not change the number of digits, as 243 is a 3-digit number.

Suppose $x$ is the value in cents of the most expensive item in Coinland that cannot be purchased using these coins with exact change.

The maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$ can be written in the form $\\tfrac{\\sqrt{m}}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$? \n Answer: To solve the problem, we start by expressing the complex number $z$ in terms of its real and imaginary parts. Let $z = x + yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers. Then we have:\n\\[ |1 + z + z^2| = 4 \\]\nSubstituting $z = x + yi$, we get:\n\\[ 1 + z + z^2 = 1 + (x + yi) + (x + yi)^2 = 1 + x + yi + x^2 + 2xyi - y^2 = (1 + x + x^2 - y^2) + (y + 2xy)i \\]\nThe magnitude of this complex number is:\n\\[ |1 + z + z^2| = \\sqrt{(1 + x + x^2 - y^2)^2 + (y + 2xy)^2} = 4 \\]\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\\[ (1 + x + x^2 - y^2)^2 + (y + 2xy)^2 = 16 \\]\nWe need to find the maximum value of the imaginary part $y$. To do this, we will consider the critical points by taking the derivative and setting it to zero. However, a simpler approach is to use the symmetry and properties of the equation. Let's use Python to find the maximum value of $y$.\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = sp.symbols('x y', real=True)\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = (1 + x + x**2 - y**2)**2 + (y + 2*x*y)**2 - 16\n\n# Solve for y in terms of x\ny_solutions = sp.solve(equation, y)\n\n# Find the maximum value of y\nmax_y = -sp.oo\nfor sol in y_solutions:\n    # Find the critical points by taking the derivative and setting it to zero\n    critical_points = sp.solve(sp.diff(sol, x), x)\n    for point in critical_points:\n        y_val = sol.subs(x, point)\n        if y_val.is_real:\n            if y_val > max_y:\n                max_y = y_val\n\n# Simplify the maximum value of y\nmax_y = sp.simplify(max_y)\nprint(max_y)\n```\n```output\nsqrt(19)/2\n```\n",
