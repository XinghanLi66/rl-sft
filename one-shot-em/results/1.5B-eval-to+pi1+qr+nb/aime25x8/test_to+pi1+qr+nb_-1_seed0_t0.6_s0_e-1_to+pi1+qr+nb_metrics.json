He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm.

He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n Question: From an unlimited supply of 1-cent coins, 10-cent coins, and 25-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $ N $ cents, where $ N $ is a positive integer.

He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n Question: From an unlimited supply of 1-cent coins, 10-cent coins, and 25-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $ N $ cents, where $ N $ is a positive integer.

He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n Question: From an unlimited supply of 1-cent coins, 10-cent coins, and 25-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $ N $ cents, where $ N $ is a positive integer.

He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n Question: From an unlimited supply of 1-cent coins, 10-cent coins, and 25-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $ N $ cents, where $ N $ is a positive integer.

He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n Question: From an unlimited supply of 1-cent coins, 10-cent coins, and 25-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $ N $ cents, where $ N $ is a positive integer.

Each of the 12 unit line segments forming the sides of the squares is colored either red or blue in such a way that each unit square has 2 red sides and 2 blue sides. Find the number of such colorings. \n Answer: To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to color the 12 line segments of a $2 \\times 2$ grid such that each of the 4 squares has exactly 2 red and 2 blue sides. We can break down the problem into a systematic approach.\n\n1. First, let's label the squares and the sides. We'll label the squares as follows:\n   - Square 1: Top-left\n   - Square 2: Top-right\n   - Square 3: Bottom-left\n   - Square 4: Bottom-right\n\n2. Each square has 4 sides, but since we need 2 red and 2 blue sides per square, we can simplify the problem by considering the constraints on each square.\n\n3. We can start by coloring the top side of the top-left square red and blue. Then we need to ensure that the adjacent squares' constraints are satisfied.\n\n4. Let's use a systematic approach to count the valid colorings. We can use a recursive or iterative method to ensure we cover all possible valid configurations.\n\nWe'll use Python to implement this systematically. Let's write the code to count the valid colorings.\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [[0]*4 for _ in range(4)]\n\n# Function to check if a given coloring is valid\ndef is_valid_coloring(grid):\n    # Check top-left square\n    if (grid[0][0] + grid[0][1] + grid[1][0] + grid[1][1]) != 2 or (grid[0][1] + grid[0][2] + grid[1][1] + grid[1][2]) != 2:\n        return False\n    # Check top-right square\n    if (grid[0][1] + grid[0][2] + grid[1][1] + grid[1][2]) != 2 or (grid[0][2] + grid[0][3] + grid[1][2] + grid[1][3]) != 2:\n        return False\n    # Check bottom-left square\n    if (grid[1][0] + grid[1][1] + grid[2][0] + grid[2][1]) != 2 or (grid[1][1] + grid[1][2] + grid[2][1] + grid[2][2]) != 2:\n        return False\n    # Check bottom-right square\n    if (grid[1][1] + grid[1][2] + grid[2][1] + grid[2][2]) != 2 or (grid[1][2] + grid[1][3] + grid[2][2] + grid[2][3]) != 2:\n        return False\n    return True\n\n# Generate all possible colorings\ncolorings = product([0, 1], repeat=12)\n\n# Count valid colorings\nvalid_count = 0\nfor coloring in colorings:\n    grid = [coloring[i:i+4] for i in range(0, 12, 4)]\n    if is_valid_coloring(grid):\n        valid_count += 1\n\nprint(valid_count)\n```\n```output\n22\n```\n",

Eight people each select a chair in which to sit so that no person sits next to two other people. Let $ N $ be the number of subsets of 16 chairs that could be selected. Find the remainder when $ N $ is divided by 1000. \n Answer: To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to choose 8 chairs out of 16 such that no two chosen chairs are adjacent. This is a combinatorial problem with constraints.\n\nLet's denote the chosen chairs by a sequence of 0s and 1s where 1 represents a chosen chair and 0 represents an unchosen chair. We need to ensure that no two 1s are adjacent. This means that between any two 1s, there must be at least one 0.\n\nTo solve this, we can use a combinatorial approach. First, let's consider a simpler problem: how many ways can we choose 8 chairs out of 16 such that no two are adjacent, but we don't have the constraint of exactly 8 chairs. We can transform this problem by introducing gaps between the chosen chairs. If we choose 8 chairs, we need 7 gaps between them. This means we have 8 chosen chairs and 7 gaps, so we need to choose the positions of these gaps from the remaining 8 positions (since we have 16 chairs in total and we need to place 8 chosen chairs and 7 gaps). This is equivalent to choosing 8 positions from 9 (8 chosen chairs + 1 extra position to account for the gaps).\n\nThe number of ways to choose 8 positions from 9 is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{9}{8}\\). However, since we need to ensure that no two chosen chairs are adjacent, we need to adjust for the fact that we are choosing 8 chairs out of 16 with the constraint that no two are adjacent. This is equivalent to choosing 8 positions from 16 - 7 = 9 positions (since we need to place 7 gaps between the 8 chosen chairs).\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 8 chairs out of 16 such that no two are adjacent is \\(\\binom{9}{8} = 9\\).\n\nHowever, we need to find the number of subsets of 16 chairs that could be selected, which means we need to consider all possible subsets of 16 chairs minus the subsets where two or more chairs are adjacent. This is a more complex combinatorial problem, but for simplicity, we can use the fact that the number of valid subsets is given by the number of ways to choose 8 non-adjacent chairs, which is \\(\\binom{9}{8} = 9\\).\n\nSince we need to find the remainder when this number is divided by 1000, the answer is simply 9. Let's confirm this with Python code.\n```python\n# Calculate the number of ways to choose 8 non-adjacent chairs out of 16\r\n# This is equivalent to choosing 8 positions from 9 (8 chosen chairs + 1 extra position to account for the gaps)\r\nfrom math import comb\r\n\r\n# Number of ways to choose 8 non-adjacent chairs out of 16\r\nN = comb(9, 8)\r\n\r\n# Find the remainder when N is divided by 1000\r\nremainder = N % 1000\r\nprint(remainder)\n```\n```output\n9\n```\n",

For $ t $ of these $ n $ values of $ x $, the graph of $ y = f(x) $ is tangent to the $ x $-axis. Find $ n + t $. \n Answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the number of values of \\( x \\) in the interval \\( 0 < x < 2\\pi \\) where \\( f(x) = \\sin(7\\pi \\cdot \\sin(5x)) = 0 \\). This happens when \\( 7\\pi \\cdot \\sin(5x) = k\\pi \\) for any integer \\( k \\). Simplifying, we get:\n\\[ \\sin(5x) = \\frac{k}{7} \\]\nSince \\(\\sin(5x)\\) must be in the range \\([-1, 1]\\), \\( k \\) must be in the range \\([-7, 7]\\). This gives us 15 possible values for \\( k \\) (from -7 to 7 inclusive). For each \\( k \\), we need to solve:\n\\[ 5x = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{7}\\right) + 2n\\pi \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 5x = \\pi - \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{7}\\right) + 2n\\pi \\]\nfor \\( n \\) being an integer. We need to find the values of \\( x \\) in the interval \\( 0 < x < 2\\pi \\). This will give us the total number of solutions \\( n \\). \n\nNext, we need to determine how many of these solutions make the graph of \\( y = f(x) \\) tangent to the \\( x \\)-axis. The graph is tangent to the \\( x \\)-axis when \\( f(x) = 0 \\) and \\( f'(x) = 0 \\). We need to find the derivative of \\( f(x) \\):\n\\[ f(x) = \\sin(7\\pi \\cdot \\sin(5x)) \\]\n\\[ f'(x) = 35\\pi \\cdot \\cos(7\\pi \\cdot \\sin(5x)) \\cdot \\cos(5x) \\]\nWe need to check how many of the solutions \\( x \\) make both \\( f(x) = 0 \\) and \\( f'(x) = 0 \\). Since \\( f(x) = 0 \\) when \\( 7\\pi \\cdot \\sin(5x) = k\\pi \\), we need to check if \\( f'(x) = 0 \\) at these points. This happens when \\( \\cos(7\\pi \\cdot \\sin(5x)) = 0 \\) or \\( \\cos(5x) = 0 \\). This gives us additional solutions. \n\nLet's use Python to compute the exact number of solutions and the number of tangent points.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the function and its derivative\ndef f(x):\n    return np.sin(7 * np.pi * np.sin(5 * x))\n\ndef f_prime(x):\n    return 35 * np.pi * np.cos(7 * np.pi * np.sin(5 * x)) * np.cos(5 * x)\n\n# Find all solutions in the interval 0 < x < 2*pi\nsolutions = []\nfor k in range(-7, 8):\n    if k == 0:\n        continue\n    arcsin_val = np.arcsin(k / 7)\n    x1 = arcsin_val / 5\n    x2 = (np.pi - arcsin_val) / 5\n    if 0 < x1 < 2 * np.pi:\n        solutions.append(x1)\n    if 0 < x2 < 2 * np.pi:\n        solutions.append(x2)\n\n# Check which solutions make the graph tangent to the x-axis\ntangent_points = [x for x in solutions if np.isclose(f_prime(x), 0, atol=1e-6)]\n\n# Number of solutions and tangent points\nn = len(solutions)\nt = len(tangent_points)\n\n# Calculate n + t\nresult = n + t\nprint((n, t, result))\n```\n```output\n(21, 3, 24)\n```\n",

Each of the 12 unit line segments forming the sides of the squares is colored either red or blue in such a way that each unit square has 2 red sides and 2 blue sides.

Let's denote the squares as follows:\n\n1. Top-left square: sides 1, 2, 5, 6\n2. Top-right square: sides 2, 3, 6, 7\n3. Bottom-left square: sides 5, 6, 7, 8\n4. Bottom-right square: sides 6, 7, 8, 9\n\nEach square must have exactly two red sides and two blue sides. We can start by noting that the color of side 6 is fixed by the requirement that the top-right and bottom-left squares each have two red sides. Once we fix the color of side 6, the colors of the other sides are constrained. Let's analyze the possible colorings step by step.\n\n1. Fix the color of side 6.\n2.

Find the number of ways to draw 12 segments of equal lengths so that each vertex in $ S $ is an endpoint of exactly one of the 12 segments.\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n Question: Let $ S $ be the set of vertices of a regular 24-gon. Find the number of ways to draw 12 segments of equal lengths so that each vertex in $ S $ is an endpoint of exactly one of the 12 segments. \n Answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to pair up the vertices of a regular 24-gon so that each pair forms a segment of equal length. This means we need to pair up the vertices in such a way that each vertex is connected to exactly one other vertex, and the distance between the connected vertices is the same for all pairs.\n\nThe vertices of a regular 24-gon can be represented by the numbers \\(0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 23\\). If we pair up the vertices such that the difference between each pair is constant, then the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to partition the set \\(\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 23\\}\\) into 12 pairs such that the difference between the elements of each pair is the same.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the number of ways to arrange 12 pairs of vertices such that the difference between the elements of each pair is the same. The difference must be a divisor of 24, and since we are pairing up the vertices, the difference must be \\(24 / 2 = 12\\). This means we can pair up the vertices as follows: \\((0, 12), (1, 13), (2, 14), \\ldots, (11, 23)\\).\n\nHowever, we need to consider the possible starting points for these pairs. The possible starting points are the numbers \\(0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 11\\), and for each starting point, there is exactly one way to pair up the vertices. Therefore, the number of ways to pair up the vertices is equal to the number of possible starting points, which is 12.\n\nThus, the number of ways to draw 12 segments of equal lengths so that each vertex in \\(S\\) is an endpoint of exactly one of the 12 segments is \\(12!\\) (since we can choose any of the 12 starting points, and then the rest of the pairs are uniquely determined).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The number of ways to pair up the vertices is 12!\nnumber_of_ways = math.factorial(12)\nprint(number_of_ways)\n```\n```output\n479001600\n```\n",

Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$. \n Answer: To solve this problem, we first need to understand the constraints and the properties of the numbers involved. We need to find the number of ordered triples $(a, b, c)$ such that $a, b, c \\leq 3^6$ and $a^3 + b^3 + c^3$ is divisible by $3^7$. This means that $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3^7}$.\n\nWe can use the properties of modular arithmetic to simplify this problem. Specifically, we can use the fact that for any integer $x$, $x^3 \\equiv 0, 1, \\text{ or } -1 \\pmod{3}$. This means that $x^3 \\equiv 0, 1, \\text{ or } -1 \\pmod{3^7}$ as well.\n\nWe can use a brute force approach to count the number of valid triples $(a, b, c)$. We will iterate over all possible values of $a, b, c$ and check if $a^3 + b^3 + c^3$ is divisible by $3^7$. If it is, we count the triple as valid.\n\nLet's write the code to solve this problem.\n```python\n# We need to count the number of valid triples (a, b, c) such that a^3 + b^3 + c^3 is divisible by 3^7\n# and a, b, c are in the range [1, 3^6].\n\n# First, we calculate 3^7\nmodulus = 3**7\n\n# Initialize the count of valid triples\ncount = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible values of a, b, c\nfor a in range(1, 3**6 + 1):\n    for b in range(1, 3**6 + 1):\n        for c in range(1, 3**6 + 1):\n            if (a**3 + b**3 + c**3) % modulus == 0:\n                count += 1\n\n# Find the remainder when the count is divided by 1000\nremainder = count % 1000\n\nprint(remainder)\n```\n```output\nTimeout Error\n```\n",

Find the number of such colorings.\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n Question: Four unit squares form a $2 \\times 2$ grid. Each of the 12 unit line segments forming the sides of the squares is colored either red or blue in such a way that each unit square has 2 red sides and 2 blue sides. Find the number of such colorings. \n Answer: To solve the problem, we need to consider the constraints given. Each unit square must have exactly 2 red sides and 2 blue sides. Let's denote the four unit squares as follows:\n\n1. Square 1: Top-left\n2. Square 2: Top-right\n3. Square 3: Bottom-left\n4. Square 4: Bottom-right\n\nFor each square, we need to ensure that it has exactly 2 red sides and 2 blue sides. Let's analyze the possible configurations for each square:\n\n1. Square 1: Top-left\n   - It has 2 sides (left and bottom).\n2. Square 2: Top-right\n   - It has 2 sides (right and bottom).\n3. Square 3: Bottom-left\n   - It has 2 sides (left and top).\n4. Square 4: Bottom-right\n   - It has 2 sides (right and top).\n\nWe need to ensure that the sides shared between squares are consistent with the requirement that each square has exactly 2 red and 2 blue sides. Let's use a systematic approach to count the valid configurations.\n\nWe can start by coloring the sides of the squares and then check the constraints. Let's use Python to enumerate all possible configurations and count the valid ones.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve the problem:\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the sides of the squares\nsides = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L']\n\n# Define the constraints for each square\ndef is_valid_configuration(config):\n    # Unpack the configuration\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L = config\n    \n    # Check the constraints for each square\n    # Square 1: Top-left\n    if (A != B and A != C) or (B != D and C != D):\n        return False\n    # Square 2: Top-right\n    if (B != C and B != D) or (C != E and D != E):\n        return False\n    # Square 3: Bottom-left\n    if (A != C and A != G) or (C != I and G != I):\n        return False\n    # Square 4: Bottom-right\n    if (D != E and D != H) or (E != F and H != F):\n        return False\n    return True\n\n# Generate all possible configurations\nall_configurations = product(['R', 'B'], repeat=12)\n\n# Count the valid configurations\nvalid_count = 0\nfor config in all_configurations:\n    if is_valid_configuration(config):\n        valid_count += 1\n\nprint(valid_count)\n```\n```output\n544\n```\n"
