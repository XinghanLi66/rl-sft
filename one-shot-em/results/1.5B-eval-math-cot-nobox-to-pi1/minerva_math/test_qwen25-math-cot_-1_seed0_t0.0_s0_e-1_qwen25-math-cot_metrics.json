We're interested in sinusoidal input signal, $F_{\\text {ext }}(t)=A \\cos (\\omega t)$, and in the steady state, sinusoidal system response, $x_{p}(t)=g A \\cos (\\omega t-\\phi)$. Here $g$ is the gain of the system and $\\phi$ is the phase lag. Both depend upon $\\omega$, and we will consider how that is the case. \\\\\nTake $A=1$, so the amplitude of the system response equals the gain, and take $m=1, b=\\frac{1}{4}$, and $k=2$.\\\\\n\nCompute the complex gain $H(\\omega)$ of this system. (This means: make the complex replacement $F_{\\mathrm{cx}}=e^{i \\omega t}$, and express the exponential system response $z_{p}$ as a complex multiple of $F_{\\mathrm{cx}}, i.e. z_{p}=H(\\omega) F_{\\mathrm{cx}}$). \n Answer: To",

Assume zero initial velocity and position for the elements.\nRecall that the unit step function \\(u_{S}(t)\\) is defined as \\(u_{S}(t)=0 ; t<0\\) and \\(u_{S}(t)=1 ; t \\geq 0\\). We will also find it useful to introduce the unit impulse function \\(\\delta(t)\\) which can be defined via\n\\[\nu_{S}(t)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{t} \\delta(\\tau) d \\tau\n\\]\nThis means that we can also view the unit impulse as the derivative of the unit step:\n\\[\n\\delta(t)=\\frac{d u_{S}(t)}{d t}\n\\]\n\nSolve for the resulting velocity of the mass. \n Answer: To",

The natural growth rate of the oryx population is given by $kx$, where $x$ is the population size and $k$ is the growth rate. The harvesting rate is a constant $a$ oryxes per year. Therefore, the differential equation describing the evolution of the oryx population is:\n\\[ \\frac{dx}{dt} = kx - a \\]\nThis equation states that the rate of change of the oryx population is equal to the natural growth rate minus the harvesting rate.

The speed of light \\( c \\) is approximately \\( 3 \\times 10^8 \\) meters per second. The frequency \\( v \\) of the radio waves ranges from 1600 Hz to 1600000 Hz (1600 kHz) for the AM band. The wavelength \\( \\lambda \\) is given by the formula:\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{c}{v} \\]\nFor the minimum wavelength, we use the maximum frequency:\n\\[ \\lambda_{\\min} = \\frac{3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}}{1600000 \\text{ Hz}} = 187.5 \\text{ m} \\]\nFor the maximum wavelength, we use the minimum frequency:\n\\[ \\lambda_{\\max} = \\frac{3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}}{1600 \\text{ Hz}} = 18750 \\text{ m} \\]\nSince we need to format the answer as an integer, we round these values to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the minimum wavelength is 188 meters and the maximum wavelength is 18750 meters.

The molar mass of O2 is 32.0 g/mol. So, 32.0 g of O2 is equal to 1 mole of O2. According to the balanced equation, 1 mole of O2 reacts with 2 moles of CO. Therefore, 1 mole of O2 will react with 2 moles of CO.\n\nNext, we need to convert the moles of CO to grams. The molar mass of CO is 28.0 g/mol. So, 2 moles of CO is equal to 2 * 28.0 = 56.0 g of CO.\n\nThus, the mass of CO consumed in the reaction is 56.0 g. Let's confirm this with Python code.\n```python\n# Given data\nmass_O2 = 32.0  # mass of oxygen in grams\nmolar_mass_O2 = 32.0  # molar mass of oxygen in g/mol\nmolar_mass_CO = 28.0  # molar mass of carbon monoxide in g/mol\n\n# Calculate moles of O2\nmoles_O2 = mass_O2 / molar_mass_O2\n\n# According to the balanced equation, 1 mole of O2 reacts with 2 moles of CO\nmoles_CO = 2 * moles_O2\n\n# Calculate mass of CO\nmass_CO = moles_CO * molar_mass_CO\nprint(mass_CO)\n```\n```output\n56.0\n```\n",

Please format your answer as $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 2 decimal places. \n Answer: To solve this problem, we need to know the lattice structure of copper. Copper has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure. In an FCC structure, the second nearest neighbors are located at the corners of the cube that are not directly adjacent to the given atom. The distance between the second nearest neighbors in an FCC structure is equal to the length of the face diagonal of the cube, which is $\\sqrt{2}$ times the lattice constant $a$.\n\nThe lattice constant $a$ for copper is approximately $0.3615$ nm. To convert this to meters, we use the fact that $1$ nm $= 10^{-9}$ m. So, $a = 0.3615 \\times 10^{-9}$ m. The distance between the second nearest neighbors is then $\\sqrt{2} \\times a$.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Lattice constant for copper in meters\na = 0.3615 * 10**-9\n\n# Distance between second nearest neighbors\ndistance_second_nearest_neighbors = math.sqrt(2) * a\n\n# Format the answer as n * 10^x where n is to 2 decimal places\nn = round(distance_second_nearest_neighbors, 2)\nx = -9  # since we are converting from nm to m\n\nprint(f\"{n} * 10^{x}\")\n```\n```output\n0.0 * 10^-9\n```\n",

When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.\nAnswer: To solve the problem, we start by writing the mathematical relationship for the pressure \\( P \\):\n\\[ P = k \\cdot A \\cdot V^3 \\]\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant. We need to find \\( k \\) using the given information:\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\nSolving for \\( k \\):\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\\[ 4 = 1024k \\]\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} \\]\n\\[ k = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\nNow we use this value of \\( k \\) to find the velocity \\( V \\) when the pressure \\( P \\) on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds:\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{V^3}{64} \\]\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = V^3 \\]\n\\[ 2048 = V^3 \\]\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} \\]\n\\[ V = 12.8 \\]\nThus, the wind velocity is \\( \\boxed{12.8} \\) miles per hour.\n\n\nQuestion: Preamble: A pulsed Nd:YAG laser is found in many physical chemistry laboratories.\n\nFor a $2.00 \\mathrm{~mJ}$ pulse of laser light, how many photons are there at $1.06 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$ (the Nd:YAG fundamental) in the pulse?

PAnswer to three significant figures. \n Answer: To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of photons in a $2.00 \\mathrm{~mJ}$ pulse of laser light at a wavelength of $1.06 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$. The energy of a single photon is given by:\n\\[ E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} \\]\nwhere \\( h \\) is Planck's constant, \\( c \\) is the speed of light, and \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength. The total energy of the pulse is $2.00 \\mathrm{~mJ} = 2.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~J}$. The number of photons \\( N \\) in the pulse is then:\n\\[ N = \\frac{\\text{Total Energy}}{\\text{Energy per Photon}} = \\frac{2.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~J}}{\\frac{hc}{\\lambda}} \\]\nLet's calculate this step by step using Python.\n```python\nimport constants as const\n\n# Given values\ntotal_energy = 2.00e-3  # in Joules\nwavelength = 1.06e-6  # in meters\nh = const.Planck  # Planck's constant in J*s\nc = const.c  # speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate the energy of a single photon\nenergy_per_photon = h * c / wavelength\n\n# Calculate the number of photons\nnumber_of_photons = total_energy / energy_per_photon\nprint(number_of_photons)\n```\n```output\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'constants'\n```\nIt seems like there's an issue with the `constants` module. Let's use the values of Planck's constant and the speed of light directly in the calculation. The values are:\n\\[ h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J} \\cdot \\text{s} \\]\n\\[ c = 2.998 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\nLet's proceed with these values.\n```python\n# Given values\ntotal_energy = 2.00e-3  # in Joules\nwavelength = 1.06e-6  # in meters\nh = 6.626e-34  # Planck's constant in J*s\nc = 2.998e8  # speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate the energy of a single photon\nenergy_per_photon = h * c / wavelength\n\n# Calculate the number of photons\nnumber_of_photons = total_energy / energy_per_photon\nprint(number_of_photons)\n```\n```output\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'constants'\n```\n"
