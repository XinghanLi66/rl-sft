Although there were twice as many right-handed players as left-handed players, the number of games won by left-handed players was $40\\%$ more than the number of games won by right-handed players. (There were no ties and no ambidextrous players.) What is the total number of games played? \n Answer: To solve this problem, let's denote the number of left-handed players as \\( L \\) and the number of right-handed players as \\( R \\). According to the problem, \\( R = 2L \\). The total number of players is \\( L + R = L + 2L = 3L \\). The total number of games played in a round-robin tournament is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{n}{2} \\), where \\( n \\) is the total number of players. So, the total number of games played is \\( \\binom{3L}{2} = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2} \\).\n\nNext, let's denote the number of games won by right-handed players as \\( W_R \\) and the number of games won by left-handed players as \\( W_L \\). According to the problem, \\( W_L = 1.4W_R \\). Since every game results in one win, the total number of games won by all players is equal to the total number of games played, which is \\( \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2} \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ W_R + W_L = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2} \\]\nSubstituting \\( W_L = 1.4W_R \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ W_R + 1.4W_R = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2} \\]\n\\[ 2.4W_R = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2} \\]\n\\[ W_R = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{4.8} \\]\nSince \\( W_R \\) must be an integer, \\( \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{4.8} \\) must be an integer. This means that \\( 3L(3L-1) \\) must be divisible by 4.8, or equivalently, \\( 3L(3L-1) \\) must be divisible by 24 (since 4.8 = 24/5 and we need to clear the fraction).\n\nLet's find the smallest \\( L \\) that satisfies this condition. We can start by checking small values of \\( L \\):\n\n- If \\( L = 1 \\), \\( 3L(3L-1) = 3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 = 6 \\), which is not divisible by 24.\n- If \\( L = 2 \\), \\( 3L(3L-1) = 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 5 = 30 \\), which is not divisible by 24.\n- If \\( L = 3 \\), \\( 3L(3L-1) = 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 8 = 72 \\), which is divisible by 24.\n\nSo, the smallest \\( L \\) that works is \\( L = 3 \\). Therefore, the total number of players is \\( 3L = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9 \\), and the total number of games played is \\( \\frac{9 \\cdot 8}{2} = 36 \\).\n\nLet's verify this solution with Python code to ensure accuracy.\n```python\n# Function to find the total number of games played\ndef find_total_games():\n    # Iterate over possible values of L\n    for L in range(1, 100):  # We assume a reasonable range for L\n        R = 2 * L\n        total_players = L + R\n        total_games = total_players * (total_players - 1) // 2\n        W_R = total_games / 2.4\n        if W_R.is_integer():\n            return total_games\n\n# Find the total number of games played\ntotal_games = find_total_games()\nprint(total_games)\n```\n```output\n36\n```\n",

A perfect square that is divisible by 5 must have a square root that is divisible by 5. This is because the square of a number that is divisible by 5 is also divisible by 5. So, we need to find all numbers of the form \\(5k\\) where \\(k\\) is an integer, and then square them to get the perfect squares. The largest integer \\(k\\) such that \\((5k)^2 < 2023\\) is the largest integer \\(k\\) such that \\(25k^2 < 2023\\). This simplifies to \\(k^2 < \\frac{2023}{25}\\), or \\(k^2 < 80.92\\). The largest integer \\(k\\) that satisfies this is 8, because \\(8^2 = 64\\) and \\(9^2 = 81\\), and \\(81 > 80.92\\). So, \\(k\\) ranges from 1 to 8. Therefore, there are 8 such perfect squares. Let's verify this with Python code.\n```python\n# Calculate the number of perfect squares less than 2023 that are divisible by 5\ncount = 0\nfor k in range(1, 9):  # k ranges from 1 to 8\n    perfect_square = (5 * k) ** 2\n    if perfect_square < 2023:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n```output\n8\n```\n",

Although there were twice as many right-handed players as left-handed players, the number of games won by left-handed players was $40\\%$ more than the number of games won by right-handed players. (There were no ties and no ambidextrous players.) What is the total number of games played? \n Answer: To solve this problem, let's denote the number of left-handed players as \\( L \\) and the number of right-handed players as \\( R \\). According to the problem, \\( R = 2L \\). The total number of players is \\( L + R = L + 2L = 3L \\). The total number of games played in a round-robin tournament is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{3L}{2} = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2} \\).\n\nLet's denote the number of games won by right-handed players as \\( W_R \\) and the number of games won by left-handed players as \\( W_L \\). According to the problem, \\( W_L = 1.4W_R \\). Since every game results in one win, the total number of games played is equal to the sum of the games won by right-handed and left-handed players, i.e., \\( W_R + W_L = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2} \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( W_L = 1.4W_R \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ W_R + 1.4W_R = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2} \\]\n\\[ 2.4W_R = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2} \\]\n\\[ W_R = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{4.8} \\]\n\\[ W_R = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{4.8} = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{\\frac{24}{5}} = \\frac{15L(3L-1)}{24} = \\frac{5L(3L-1)}{8} \\]\n\nSince \\( W_R \\) must be an integer, \\( \\frac{5L(3L-1)}{8} \\) must be an integer. This means that \\( 5L(3L-1) \\) must be divisible by 8. We need to find the smallest \\( L \\) that satisfies this condition. Let's check the values of \\( L \\) starting from 1.\n\nFor \\( L = 1 \\):\n\\[ 5 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (3 \\cdot 1 - 1) = 5 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 = 10 \\]\n10 is not divisible by 8.\n\nFor \\( L = 2 \\):\n\\[ 5 \\cdot 2 \\cdot (3 \\cdot 2 - 1) = 5 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 5 = 50 \\]\n50 is not divisible by 8.\n\nFor \\( L = 3 \\):\n\\[ 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot (3 \\cdot 3 - 1) = 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 8 = 120 \\]\n120 is divisible by 8.\n\nSo, \\( L = 3 \\) is the smallest value that satisfies the condition. Therefore, the total number of players is \\( 3L = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9 \\). The total number of games played is:\n\\[ \\frac{9 \\cdot 8}{2} = 36 \\]\n\nLet's verify this with Python code to ensure the accuracy.\n```python\n# Function to find the total number of games played\ndef find_total_games():\n    # Iterate over possible values of L\n    for L in range(1, 100):\n        if (5 * L * (3 * L - 1)) % 8 == 0:\n            total_players = 3 * L\n            total_games = (total_players * (total_players - 1)) // 2\n            return total_games\n\n# Find the total number of games played\ntotal_games = find_total_games()\nprint(total_games)\n```\n```output\n36\n```\n",

Running shoes were on sale, with prices reduced by $20\\%$ on every pair of shoes. Carlos also knew that he had to pay a $7.5\\%$ sales tax on the discounted price. He had $$43$ dollars. What is the original (before discount) price of the most expensive shoes he could afford to buy? \n Answer: To solve this problem, we need to determine the original price of the shoes before the discount and tax. Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. Let the original price of the shoes be \\( P \\).\n2. After a 20% discount, the price becomes \\( 0.8P \\).\n3. A 7.5% sales tax is then applied to the discounted price, so the final price Carlos pays is \\( 0.8P \\times 1.075 \\).\n4. We know that Carlos has $43, so we can set up the equation:\n\\[ 0.8P \\times 1.075 = 43 \\]\n5. Solving for \\( P \\):\n\\[ 0.85P = 43 \\]\n\\[ P = \\frac{43}{0.85} \\]\nLet's calculate this value using Python.\n```python\n# Given values\nfinal_price = 43\ndiscount_rate = 0.20\ntax_rate = 0.075\n\n# Calculate the original price\noriginal_price = final_price / ((1 - discount_rate) * (1 + tax_rate))\nprint(original_price)\n```\n```output\n50.0\n```\n",

This inequality describes a square with side length 2 centered at (1, 1) in the coordinate plane. The region is symmetric and can be visualized as a square with vertices at (0, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), and (0, 2).\n\nThe area of this square is simply the side length squared. Since the side length is 2, the area is \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n\nLet's confirm this with Python code. We can use a simple geometric calculation to verify the area.\n```python\n# The side length of the square is 2, so the area is side_length^2\nside_length = 2\narea = side_length ** 2\nprint(area)\n```\n```output\n4\n```\n",

Your goal is to find at least one square that is covered by the rectangle. A \"turn\" consists of you guessing a square, after which you are told whether that square is covered by the hidden rectangle. What is the minimum number of turns you need to ensure that at least one of your guessed squares is covered by the rectangle? \n Answer: To solve this problem, we need to consider the worst-case scenario. The $3 \\times 3$ grid has 9 squares, and the rectangle covers 2 adjacent squares. The worst-case scenario is that the rectangle covers two squares that are not adjacent to each other. In this case, we need to guess all the squares to ensure that we find at least one square that is covered by the rectangle. However, we can use a more efficient strategy to minimize the number of guesses.\n\nWe can use a strategy that involves guessing the squares in a way that maximizes the information we get from each guess. One such strategy is to guess the squares in a way that covers the maximum number of possible positions for the rectangle. For example, we can guess the squares in a way that covers all possible positions of the rectangle, which means we need to guess at most 5 squares to ensure that we find at least one square that is covered by the rectangle.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to confirm the minimum number of turns needed.\n```python\n# The grid is 3x3, and the rectangle covers 2 adjacent squares.\n# We need to find the minimum number of turns to ensure that at least one of the guessed squares is covered by the rectangle.\n\n# The worst-case scenario is that the rectangle covers two squares that are not adjacent to each other.\n# In this case, we need to guess all the squares to ensure that we find at least one square that is covered by the rectangle.\n# However, we can use a more efficient strategy to minimize the number of guesses.\n\n# We can use a strategy that involves guessing the squares in a way that maximizes the information we get from each guess.\n# One such strategy is to guess the squares in a way that covers all possible positions of the rectangle.\n# This means we need to guess at most 5 squares to ensure that we find at least one square that is covered by the rectangle.\n\n# Let's confirm this with a simple simulation.\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n\n# Define the possible positions of the rectangle\npossible_positions = [\n    [(0, 0), (0, 1)], [(0, 1), (0, 2)], [(1, 0), (1, 1)], [(1, 1), (1, 2)], [(2, 0), (2, 1)], [(2, 1), (2, 2)]\n]\n\n# Function to check if a guess covers the rectangle\ndef covers_rectangle(guess, possible_positions):\n    for pos in possible_positions:\n        if (guess[0] in pos and guess[1] in pos):\n            return True\n    return False\n\n# Function to find the minimum number of turns\ndef find_min_turns():\n    # We need to guess at most 5 squares to ensure that we find at least one square that is covered by the rectangle\n    # Let's simulate this\n    turns = 0\n    guessed_squares = set()\n    while len(guessed_squares) < 5:\n        # Guess a square\n        guess = (0, 0)  # We can start by guessing the top-left corner\n        # Check if the guess covers the rectangle\n        if covers_rectangle(guess, possible_positions):\n            guessed_squares.add(guess)\n            turns += 1\n            break\n        # If the guess does not cover the rectangle, we need to guess another square\n        else:\n            # We can guess another square in a way that maximizes the information we get from each guess\n            # For example, we can guess the square that is not covered by the rectangle\n            for i in range(3):\n                for j in range(3):\n                    if (i, j) not in guessed_squares:\n                        guess = (i, j)\n                        turns += 1\n                        break\n                if turns == 5:\n                    break\n    return turns\n\n# Find the minimum number of turns\nmin_turns = find_min_turns()\nprint(min_turns)\n```\n```output\nTimeout Error\n```\n",

What is the units digits of the sum of the 2023 numbers in the 2023rd row? \n Answer: To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern in the triangular array. Let's denote the \\(n\\)-th row by \\(R_n\\). The first row \\(R_1\\) is \\([1]\\). The second row \\(R_2\\) is \\([1, 1]\\). The third row \\(R_3\\) is \\([1, 3, 1]\\).

The first and last elements of each row are always 1. The interior elements are formed by adding 1 to the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it in the previous row.\n\nTo find the units digit of the sum of the 2023 numbers in the 2023rd row, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Generate the 2023rd row.\n2. Sum the elements of the 2023rd row.\n3. Extract the units digit of the sum.\n\nLet's write the Python code to achieve this.\n```python\ndef generate_row(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return [1]\n    elif n == 2:\n        return [1, 1]\n    else:\n        prev_row = generate_row(n-1)\n        row = [1]\n        for i in range(len(prev_row)-1):\n            row.append(prev_row[i] + prev_row[i+1] + 1)\n        row.append(1)\n        return row\n\n# Generate the 2023rd row\nrow_2023 = generate_row(2023)\n\n# Calculate the sum of the 2023rd row\nsum_2023 = sum(row_2023)\n\n# Get the units digit of the sum\nunits_digit = sum_2023 % 10\nprint(units_digit)\n```\n```output\nRecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison\n```\n",

A perfect square that is divisible by 5 must have a square root that is divisible by 5. This is because the square of a number that is divisible by 5 is also divisible by 5. So, we need to find all numbers \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 < 2023 \\) and \\( n \\) is divisible by 5. The largest integer \\( n \\) that satisfies \\( n^2 < 2023 \\) is \\( \\lfloor \\sqrt{2022} \\rfloor \\). We can then count all multiples of 5 up to this value. Let's calculate this using Python.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the largest integer n such that n^2 < 2023\nmax_n = int(math.sqrt(2022))\n\n# Find all multiples of 5 up to max_n\nmultiples_of_5 = [n for n in range(5, max_n + 1, 5)]\n\n# The number of such multiples is the answer\nnum_perfect_squares_divisible_by_5 = len(multiples_of_5)\nprint(num_perfect_squares_divisible_by_5)\n```\n```output\n8\n```\n",
