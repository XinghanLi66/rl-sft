","To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the pressure \( P \), the area \( A \), and the velocity \( V \). The problem states that the pressure \( P \) varies jointly as the area \( A \) and the cube of the velocity \( V \). This means we can write the relationship as:
\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]
where \( k \) is a constant.

First, we need to find the constant \( k \). We know that when the velocity \( V = 8 \) miles per hour and the area \( A = 2 \) square feet, the pressure \( P = 4 \) pounds. So we can substitute these values into the equation to find \( k \):
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now that we have the constant \( k \), we can use it to find the velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P = 32 \) pounds and the area \( A = 4 \) square feet. We substitute these values into the equation:
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]
\[ V = 12.6992 \approx 12.7 \]

Let's confirm this with Python code to ensure the accuracy of the result.
```python
# Given values
P1 = 4  # pressure in pounds
A1 = 2  # area in square feet
V1 = 8  # velocity in miles per hour

# Calculate the constant k
k = P1 / (A1 * V1**3)

# New values

","The pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). This means \( P = kA V^3 \), where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality. We need to determine the value of \( k \) using the given conditions and then use it to find the velocity when the pressure on a 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.

Given:
- When \( V = 8 \) miles per hour and \( A = 2 \) square feet, \( P = 4 \) pounds.
- We need to find \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet.

First, we can find the constant \( k \) using the initial condition:
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

So the equation for pressure becomes:
\[ P = \frac{1}{256} \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

Now, we need to find \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet:
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]
\[ V = 12.699 \approx 12.7 \text{ miles per hour} \]

","To solve this problem, we need to use the given information to find the constant of proportionality \( k \), and then use that constant to find the wind velocity \( V \) when the pressure on a 4 square foot sail is 32 pounds.

The relationship given is:

","To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Understand the relationship between pressure \( P \), area \( A \), and wind velocity \( V \). The pressure varies jointly as the area and the cube of the wind's velocity. This can be written as:
   \[
   P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3
   \]
   where \( k \) is a constant.

2. Use the given values to find the constant \( k \). We are given that when \( V = 8 \) miles per hour, \( A = 2 \) square feet, and \( P = 4 \) pounds. Substitute these values into the equation to find \( k \):
   \[

   Simplify the right-hand side:

   Solve for \( k \):

3. Use the constant \( k \) to find the wind velocity \( V \) when \( A = 4 \) square feet and \( P = 32 \) pounds. Substitute these values into the equation and solve for \( V \):
   \[
   32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3
   \]
   Simplify the right-hand side:
   \[
   32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 64 to isolate \( V^3 \):
   \[
   32 \cdot 64 = V^3
   \]
   Simplify the left-hand side:
   \[
   2048 = V^3

   Take the cube root of both sides to solve for \( V \):
   \[

","To solve the problem, we need to use the given information to determine the relationship between the pressure \( P \), the area \( A \), and the velocity \( V \). The relationship is given as:

\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.

First, we will use the given information to find the constant \( k \). We know that when \( V = 8 \) miles per hour, \( A = 2 \) square feet, and \( P = 4 \) pounds. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]

Solving for \( k \):

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now we have the constant \( k \). Next, we need to find the velocity \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet. Substituting these values into the equation:

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]
\[ V = 12.699239810099314 \approx 12.7 \text{ miles per hour} \]

","Given that the pressure \( P \) varies jointly with the area \( A \) and the cube of the velocity \( V \), we can express this relationship as:

$$ P = kA V^3 $$

where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.

First, we need to find the constant \( k \) using the given values. When \( P = 4 \) pounds, \( A = 2 \) square feet, and \( V = 8 \) miles per hour:

$$ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 $$

Calculate \( 8^3 \):

$$ 8^3 = 512 $$

So, the equation becomes:

$$ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 $$

Simplify and solve for \( k \):

$$ 4 = 1024k $$
$$ k = \frac{4}{1024} $$
$$ k = \frac{1}{256} $$

Now we have the relationship:

$$ P = \frac{1}{256} A V^3 $$

Next, we use this relationship to find the wind velocity \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet:

$$ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 $$

Simplify the equation:

$$ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 $$
$$ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 $$

Multiply both sides by \( 64 \) to isolate \( V^3 \):

$$ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 $$
$$ 2048 = V^3 $$

To solve for \( V \), take the cube root of both sides:

$$ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} $$

Calculate the cube root:

$$ V = 12.4072 \text{ miles per hour (approx.)} $$

Therefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds is approximately \( 12.41 \) miles per hour. So, the final answer is:

$$ \boxed{12.41} $$

Consider a function \( f(x) \) defined on the interval \([0, 2\pi]\) by \( f(x) = \cos(x) + \sin(x) \). Let \( a_n \) and \( b_n \) be the Fourier coefficients of \( f(x) \), given by:

\[ a_n = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{0}^{2\pi} f(x) \cos(nx) \, dx \]
\[ b_n = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{0}^{2\pi} f(x) \sin(nx) \, dx \]

1. Find the Fourier coefficients \( a_n \) and \( b_n \).
2. Determine the sum \( S = \sum_{n=1}^{N} (a_n^2 + b_n^2) \) for \( N = 3 \). Step 1: Compute \( a_n \) and \( b_n \)

First, we need to compute \( a_n \) and \( b_n \) for the given function \( f(x) = \cos(x) + \sin(x) \).

For \( a_n \):

\[ a_n = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{0}^{2\pi} (\cos(x) + \sin(x)) \cos(nx) \, dx \]

Using the orthogonality of trigonometric functions:

\[ \int_{0}^{2\pi} \cos(x) \cos(nx) \, dx = \begin{cases} 
\pi & \text{if } n = 1 \\
0 & \text{otherwise} 
\end{cases} \]

\[ \int_{0}^{2\pi} \sin(x) \cos(nx) \, dx = 0 \]

Thus, \( a_n = \frac{1}{\pi} \left( \pi \delta_{n1} + 0 \right) = \delta_{n1} \), where \( \delta_{n1} \) is the Kronecker delta function.

For \( b_n \):

\[ b_n = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{0}^{2\pi} (\cos(x) + \sin(x)) \sin(nx) \, dx \]

Using the orthogonality of trigonometric functions:

\[ \int_{0}^{2\pi} \cos(x) \sin(nx) \, dx = 0 \]
\[ \int_{0}^{2\pi} \sin(x) \sin(nx) \, dx = \begin{cases} 
\pi & \text{if } n = 1 \\
0 & \text{otherwise} 
\end{cases} \]

Thus, \( b_n = \frac{1}{\pi} \left( 0 + \pi \delta_{n1} \right) = \delta_{n1} \).

Step 2: Determine the sum \( S \)

We need to compute \( S = \sum_{n=1}^{N} (a_n^2 + b_n^2) \) for \( N = 3 \).

For \( N = 3 \):

\[ S = \sum_{n=1}^{3} (a_n^2 + b_n^2) \]

Since \( a_n = \delta_{n1} \) and \( b_n = \delta_{n1} \):

\[ S = \sum_{n=1}^{3} (\delta_{n1}^2 + \delta_{n1}^2) \]

3. Find \( V \) when \( A = 4 \) square feet and \( P = 32 \) pounds.

First, let's express the relationship between \( P \), \( A \), and \( V \) mathematically. If \( P \) varies jointly as \( A \) and \( V^3 \), we can write:

\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.

#### Step 1: Find the constant \( k \)
Using the given values \( A = 2 \), \( V = 8 \), and \( P = 4 \):

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]

First, calculate \( 8^3 \):

\[ 8^3 = 8 \cdot 8 \cdot 8 = 512 \]

Now, substitute \( 8^3 \) into the equation:

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]

Solve for \( k \):

\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

#### Step 2: Use \( k \) to find \( V \) when \( A = 4 \) and \( P = 32 \)

Using the constant \( k \) we found, write the equation with the new values:

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]

First, calculate \( \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \):

\[ \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 = \frac{4}{256} = \frac{1}{64} \]

Now, the equation becomes:

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]

Multiply both sides by \( 64 \) to isolate \( V^3 \):

\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]

Take the cube root of both sides to solve for \( V \):

\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]

Since \( 2048 = 2^{11} \), we get:

\[ V = 2^{\frac{11}{3}} = 2^3 \cdot 2^{\frac{2}{3}} = 8 \cdot \sqrt[3]{4} \]

Therefore, the wind velocity \( V \) is:

\[ V = 8 \cdot \sqrt[3]{4} \text{ miles per hour} \]

","The pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

where \( k \) is a constant.

First, we need to find the constant \( k \) using the given information: when \( V = 8 \) mph and \( A = 2 \) square feet, \( P = 4 \) pounds. Substituting these values into the equation:

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]

\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]

\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} \]

\[ k = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now we need to find the wind velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P \) on a sail of \( 4 \) square feet is \( 32 \) pounds. Substituting these values into the equation:

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]

\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]

\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]

\[ 2048 = V^3 \]

Taking the cube root of both sides:

\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]

\[ V = 12.699 \approx 12.7 \]

","Given that the pressure \( P \) varies jointly as the area \( A \) and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \), we can write the relationship as:

\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

where \( k \) is a constant.

Step 1: Use the given values to find the constant \( k \).

We know that when \( A = 2 \) square feet and \( V = 8 \) miles per hour, \( P = 4 \) pounds. Plugging these values into the equation gives us:

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]

First, calculate \( 8^3 \):

\[ 8^3 = 512 \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]

Simplify to find \( k \):

\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]

\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} \]

\[ k = \frac{1}{256} \]

Step 2: Use the constant \( k \) to find the wind velocity when \( A = 4 \) square feet and \( P = 32 \) pounds.

The equation is now:

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]

Simplify the right-hand side:

\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]

Multiply both sides by 64 to isolate \( V^3 \):

\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]

\[ 2048 = V^3 \]

Step 3: Solve for \( V \).

To find \( V \), take the cube root of both sides:

\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]

Simplify the cube root:

\[ V = 12.8 \] miles per hour

So, the wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds is \( 12.8 \) miles per hour.

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]

Let's calculate \( 8^3 \):

\[ 8^3 = 8 \times 8 \times 8 = 512 \]

Now, substitute \( 512 \) back into the equation:

\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]

To find \( k \), divide both sides by \( 1024 \):

Now that we have \( k \), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds. Substitute \( P = 32 \) and \( A = 4 \) into the equation \( P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \):

Simplify the equation:

","First, we express the relationship between the pressure \( P \), the area \( A \), and the wind's velocity \( V \) mathematically. According to the problem, the pressure \( P \) varies jointly as the area \( A \) and the cube of the velocity \( V \). This can be written as:

\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.

Given the first scenario, when \( A = 2 \) square feet and \( V = 8 \) miles per hour, the pressure \( P \) is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the constant \( k \):

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]

First, calculate \( 8^3 \):

\[ 8^3 = 512 \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} \]
\[ k = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now we have the constant \( k \). Next, we need to find the velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P \) is 32 pounds and the area \( A \) is 4 square feet. We use the same equation \( P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \) and substitute the known values:

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]

Simplify the right side of the equation:

\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]

Now, solve for \( V^3 \):

\[ V^3 = 32 \cdot 64 \]
\[ V^3 = 2048 \]

Take the cube root of both sides to solve for \( V \):

\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]

Using Python to get the exact value:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the cube root of 2048
V = sp.cbrt(2048)
print(V)
```
```output
8*2**(1/3)
```
The cube root of 2048 is \( 8 \cdot 2^{1/3} \). We can simplify this further to get the exact value. Since \( 2048 = 2^{11} \), we can take the cube root:

\[ 2048 = 2^{11} \]
\[ \sqrt[3]{2048} = \sqrt[3]{2^{11}} = 2^{11/3} = 2^3 \cdot 2^{2/3} = 8 \cdot 2^{2/3} = 8 \cdot \sqrt[3]{4} \]

Thus, the exact value of \( V \) is \( 8 \cdot \sqrt[3]{4} \).

\[ P = 4 \text{ pounds}, \quad A = 2 \text{ square feet}, \quad V = 8 \text{ miles per hour} \]
Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now we have the constant \( k \), and we can use it to find the wind velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P \) is 32 pounds and the area \( A \) is 4 square feet. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]
\[ V = 8\sqrt[3]{2} \]

Let's calculate the numerical value of \( V \) using Python to ensure accuracy.
```python
import sympy as sp

# Given values
P = 32  # pounds
A = 4   # square feet

# Constant k
k = 1 / 256

The only real solution for the wind velocity \( V \) is approximately \( 12.70 \) miles per hour. The other two solutions are complex numbers, which are not physically meaningful in this context.

The pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). When the velocity is \( 8 \) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \( 2 \) square feet is \( 4 \) pounds.

","1. Understanding the Relationship:
   The problem states that the pressure \( P \) varies jointly with the area \( A \) and the cube of the velocity \( V \). This means we can express the relationship as:
   \[
   P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3
   \]
   where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.

2. Using the Given Values to Find \( k \):
   We are given:
   \[
   P = 4 \text{ pounds}, \quad A = 2 \text{ square feet}, \quad V = 8 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]
   Substituting these values into our equation gives:
   \[
   4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3
   \]
   Calculating \( 8^3 \):
   \[
   8^3 = 8 \cdot 8 \cdot 8 = 512
   \]
   So,
   \[
   4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512
   \]
   \[
   4 = k \cdot 1024
   \]
   Solving for \( k \):
   \[
   k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256}
   \]

3. Using \( k \) to Find \( V \):
   We need to find the velocity \( V \) when:
   \[
   P = 32 \text{ pounds}, \quad A = 4 \text{ square feet}
   \]
   Using our formula with \( k \):
   \[
   32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3
   \]
   \[
   32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by 64:
   \[
   32 \cdot 64 = V^3
   \]
   \[
   2048 = V^3
   \]
   Taking the cube root of both sides:
   \[
   V = \sqrt[3]{2048}
   \]
   Simplifying the cube root:
   \[
   V = 12 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

4. Conclusion:
   Therefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds is \( 12 \) miles per hour. We can express the final answer as:

","To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of joint variation. The pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). This can be expressed mathematically as:

\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.

Given:
1. When \( V = 8 \) miles per hour and \( A = 2 \) square feet, \( P = 4 \) pounds.
2. We need to find the wind velocity \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet.

First, we can use the given values to find the constant \( k \):

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]

\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]
\[ V = 12.6992124 \]

","We start by setting up the formula for the pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area \( A \) and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \), we can write:

\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

where \( k \) is the constant of proportionality.

Given that the pressure \( P \) is \( 4 \) pounds when the area \( A \) is \( 2 \) square feet and the velocity \( V \) is \( 8 \) miles per hour, we can use this information to find the constant \( k \).

First, plug in the known values:

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]

Calculate \( 8^3 \):

\[ 8^3 = 512 \]

So, the equation becomes:

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]

Simplify the right-hand side:

\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]

Solve for \( k \):

\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now, we know the value of \( k \). Next, we need to find the wind velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P \) is \( 32 \) pounds and the area \( A \) is \( 4 \) square feet.

Using the formula \( P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \), substitute the known values:

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]

Simplify the right-hand side:

\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]

Multiply both sides by \( 64 \) to isolate \( V^3 \):

\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]

\[ 2048 = V^3 \]

To find \( V \), take the cube root of both sides:

\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]

\[ V = 12.527 \text{ miles per hour (approx)} \]

Thus, the wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds is approximately \( 12.527 \) miles per hour.

Given the function $f(x)=x^{2}+ax+b$ $(a,b \in \mathbb{R})$ has a range of $[0,+\infty)$, if the solution set of the inequality $f(x) < c$ is $(m, m+8)$, then the value of the real number $c$ is __________. To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Range of the Function:**
   The function \(f(x) = x^2 + ax + b\) has a range of \([0, +\infty)\). This means that the minimum value of the quadratic function is 0. The minimum value of a quadratic function \(f(x) = x^2 + ax + b\) occurs at \(x = -\frac{a}{2}\), and the value at this point is \(f\left(-\frac{a}{2}\right) = \left(-\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + a\left(-\frac{a}{2}\right) + b = \frac{a^2}{4} - \frac{a^2}{2} + b = b - \frac{a^2}{4}\). Since the minimum value is 0, we have:
   \[
   b - \frac{a^2}{4} = 0 \implies b = \frac{a^2}{4}
   \]
   So, the function can be written as:
   \[
   f(x) = x^2 + ax + \frac{a^2}{4} = \left(x + \frac{a}{2}\right)^2
   \]

2. **Understand the Inequality:**
   We need to find the solution set of the inequality \(f(x) < c\):
   \[
   \left(x + \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 < c
   \]
   Taking the square root on both sides, we get:
   \[
   -\sqrt{c} < x + \frac{a}{2} < \sqrt{c}
   \]
   Solving for \(x\), we get:
   \[
   -\sqrt{c} - \frac{a}{2} < x < \sqrt{c} - \frac{a}{2}
   \]
   This means the solution set is \(\left(-\sqrt{c} - \frac{a}{2}, \sqrt{c} - \frac{a}{2}\right)\). We are given that the solution set is \((m, m+8)\), so we can equate:
   \[

When the velocity is \( 8 \) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \( 2 \) square feet is \( 4 \) pounds.

","Given:
- Pressure \( P \) varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). This can be expressed as \( P = kA V^3 \), where \( k \) is a constant.
- When \( V = 8 \) mph and \( A = 2 \) square feet, \( P = 4 \) pounds.

First, we need to find the constant \( k \) using the given values:
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now that we have the constant \( k \), we can use it to find the wind velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P \) is 32 pounds and the area \( A \) is 4 square feet. We can use the equation \( P = kA V^3 \) again:
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{4V^3}{256} \]
\[ 32 = \frac{V^3}{64} \]
\[ V^3 = 32 \cdot 64 \]
\[ V^3 = 2048 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]
\[ V = 12.6992 \approx 12.7 \text{ mph} \]

Let's verify this by running the calculation in Python.
```python
# Given values
P1 = 4  # initial pressure in pounds
A1 = 2  # initial area in square feet

  \[
  P = kA V^3

First, we need to find \( k \) using the given values:
- When \( A = 2 \) square feet and \( V = 8 \) miles per hour, \( P = 4 \) pounds. 

Substitute these values into the equation to solve for \( k \):
\[
4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3

Calculate \( 8^3 \):
\[
8^3 = 512

Now substitute back into the equation:

Simplify and solve for \( k \):
\[
4 = 1024k

\[
k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256}

Now that we have \( k \), we can find the wind velocity \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet.

Using the equation \( P = kA V^3 \) and substituting the known values:
\[

Simplify and solve for \( V^3 \):

\[
32 = \frac{1}{64} V^3

\[
32 \cdot 64 = V^3

Let \( \frac{p}{q} \) be a rational number in lowest terms, where \( p \) and \( q \) are integers with \( q \neq 0 \). Define the function \( f(x) = \left\lfloor x \right\rfloor \) which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x \). 

Find the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( f\left( \frac{p}{q} + n \right) = f\left( \frac{p}{q} \right) \). To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of the floor function \( f(x) = \left\lfloor x \right\rfloor \). This function returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x \).

Let's consider the given rational number \( \frac{p}{q} \). We are looking for the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that adding \( n \) to \( \frac{p}{q} \) does not change the floor value.

First, note that if \( \frac{p}{q} \) is an integer, then \( f\left( \frac{p}{q} \right) = \frac{p}{q} \). If \( \frac{p}{q} \) is not an integer, then \( f\left( \frac{p}{q} \right) \) will be the greatest integer less than \( \frac{p}{q} \).

For the floor function to not change its value when adding \( n \), \( n \) must be such that it does not make \( \frac{p}{q} + n \) exceed the next integer. This implies that \( n \) must be less than 1, since any positive integer would increase \( \frac{p}{q} \) beyond its current floor value.

Therefore, the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies the condition is \( n = 1 \). This is because adding 1 to any rational number will generally increase its value, and thus its floor value unless it is already an integer.

Let's verify this with an example:

1. If \( \frac{p}{q} = 3 \) (an integer), then \( f\left( \frac{p}{q} \right) = 3 \). Adding any positive integer \( n \) (including \( n = 1 \)) will result in \( \frac{p}{q} + n = 3 + 1 = 4 \), and \( f(4) = 4 \). Thus, \( f\left( \frac{p}{q} + n \right) = f\left( \frac{p}{q} \right) \).

2. If \( \frac{p}{q} = 3.2 \) (not an integer), then \( f\left( \frac{p}{q} \right) = 3 \). Adding any positive integer \( n \) (including \( n = 1 \)) will result in \( \frac{p}{q} + n = 3.2 +",0.29375

When the velocity is \( 8 \) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \( 2 \) square feet is \( 4 \) pounds.

","Given that the pressure \( P \) varies jointly as the area \( A \) and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \), we can express this relationship as:
\[ P = kA \cdot V^3 \]
where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.

#### Step 1: Find the Constant of Proportionality \( k \)
First, we use the given information to find the constant \( k \). When \( V = 8 \) mph, \( A = 2 \) square feet, and \( P = 4 \) pounds:
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = 1024k \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} \]
\[ k = \frac{1}{256} \]

#### Step 2: Use the Constant to Find the Wind Velocity
Now, we use the constant \( k \) to find the wind velocity \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet. Substituting these values into the equation:
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( V \)
To find \( V \), we take the cube root of both sides:
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]
\[ V = 12.8 \]

So, the wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds is \( 12.8 \) miles per hour.

","To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of joint variation. The pressure \( P \) varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). This means we can write the relationship as:
\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]
where \( k \) is a constant.

First, we need to find the constant \( k \) using the given values:
\[ P = 4 \text{ pounds}, \quad A = 2 \text{ square feet}, \quad V = 8 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now we have the equation:
\[ P = \frac{1}{256} \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

Next, we need to find the wind velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P \) is 32 pounds and the area \( A \) is 4 square feet:
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]

Let's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.
```python
# Given values
P1 = 4  # pounds
A1 = 2  # square feet
V1 = 8  # miles per hour

# Calculate the constant k
k = P1 / (A1 * V1**3)

# New values
P2 = 32  # pounds
A2 = 4  # square feet

# Calculate the new wind velocity V2
V2 = (P2 / k) ** (1/3)
print(V2)
```
```output
12.699208415745595
```
The wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is approximately \( 12.70 \) miles per hour. Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12.70}
\]

The graph of the equation $y = |x| - 3$ is reflected over the x-axis, then each point on the new graph is scaled by a factor of 1/2. What are the coordinates of the minimum point of the modified graph after these transformations? Let's break down the transformations step by step:

1. **Original Equation:** $y = |x| - 3$
2. **Reflect Over the x-axis:** This changes the sign of the y-coordinates. So the new equation becomes $y = -(|x| - 3) = -|x| + 3$.
3. **Scale by a Factor of 1/2:** This changes the y-coordinates by multiplying by 1/2. So the new equation becomes $y = \frac{1}{2}(-|x| + 3) = -\frac{1}{2}|x| + \frac{3}{2}$.

The minimum point of the original graph $y = |x| - 3$ is at $(0, -3)$. After reflecting over the x-axis, the minimum point is at $(0, 3)$. Then, scaling by a factor of 1/2, the minimum point becomes $\left(0, \frac{3}{2}\right)$.

The coordinates of the minimum point of the modified graph after these transformations are $\left(0, \frac{3}{2}\right)$.

Let's verify this with Python code to ensure accuracy.
```python
# Define the original function
def original_function(x):
    return abs(x) - 3

# Reflect over the x-axis
def reflected_function(x):
    return -original_function(x)

# Scale by a factor of 1/2
def scaled_function(x):
    return 0.5 * reflected_function(x)

# Find the minimum point of the scaled function
import numpy as np

# We can check the function at a range of x values to find the minimum
x_values = np.linspace(-10, 10, 400)
y_values = scaled_function(x_values)

# Find the minimum y value and corresponding x value
min_y = np.min(y_values)
min_x = x_values[np.argmin(y_values)]

print(((min_x, min_y)))
```
```output
(-5.012531328320801, 1.4987468671679195)
```
The minimum point of the modified graph, as calculated by the code, is approximately $\left(-5.0125, 1.4987\right)$. However, this is not the exact minimum point. Given the symmetry of the function $y = -\frac{1}{2}|x| + \frac{3}{2}$, the exact minimum point is at $x = 0$, which gives us $y = \frac{3}{2}$.

Therefore, the exact coordinates of the minimum point of the modified graph are:
\[
\boxed{\left(0, \frac{3}{2}\right)}

","The pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). This means that the relationship can be described by the equation:

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]

We need to calculate \( 8^3 \):
\[ 8^3 = 8 \times 8 \times 8 = 512 \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]

Now, solve for \( k \):
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} \]
\[ k = \frac{1}{256} \]

### Step 2: Using the constant \( k \) to find the new velocity \( V \)

We need to find the wind velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P \) is \( 32 \) pounds and the area \( A \) is \( 4 \) square feet.

Using the equation:
\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

Substitute \( P = 32 \), \( A = 4 \), and \( k = \frac{1}{256} \):
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]

Simplify the right-hand side:
\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]

Now, solve for \( V^3 \):
\[ V^3 = 32 \times 64 \]
\[ V^3 = 2048 \]

To find \( V \), take the cube root of both sides:
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]

Calculate the cube root:
\[ V = 12.8 \]

### Final Answer
The wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds is \( 12.8 \) miles per hour.

Thus, the answer is:

","Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. The pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). This can be written as:
\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]
where \( k \) is a constant.

2. We are given that when \( V = 8 \) miles per hour, \( A = 2 \) square feet, and \( P = 4 \) pounds. We can use this information to find the constant \( k \).

3. Substitute the given values into the equation:
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

4. Now we need to find the wind velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P = 32 \) pounds and the area \( A = 4 \) square feet. We can use the equation with the constant \( k \) we just found:
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{4 \cdot V^3}{256} \]
\[ 32 = \frac{V^3}{64} \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]
\[ V = 12.6992 \]

Since we are dealing with a physical quantity, we should round to a reasonable number of decimal places. In this case, we can round to the nearest whole number, so \( V = 13 \) miles per hour.

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   The pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). This can be expressed mathematically as:
   \[
   P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3

   where \( k \) is a constant.

2. **Find the Constant \( k \):**
   Given that when \( V = 8 \) miles per hour, \( P = 4 \) pounds, and \( A = 2 \) square feet, we can substitute these values into the equation to find \( k \):
   \[
   4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3

   Solving for \( k \):
   \[
   k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256}
   \]

3. **Find the Wind Velocity \( V \):**
   We are given that when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet, we need to find \( V \). Substituting these values and the constant \( k \) into the equation:

   Solving for \( V^3 \):
   \[

   Taking the cube root of both sides:
   \[
   V = \sqrt[3]{2048}

First, we need to determine the constant \( k \) using the given information. We know that when \( V = 8 \) miles per hour and \( A = 2 \) square feet, the pressure \( P \) is 4 pounds. Substituting these values into the equation:

If the proposition ""There exists $x \in \mathbb{R}$, such that $x^2 + (a-1)x + 1 \leq 0$"" is false, then the range of the real number $a$ is \_\_\_\_\_\_. To determine the range of the real number \(a\) such that the proposition ""There exists \(x \in \mathbb{R}\), such that \(x^2 + (a-1)x + 1 \leq 0\)"" is false, we need to ensure that the quadratic equation \(x^2 + (a-1)x + 1 = 0\) does not have any real roots or that any real roots it does have are not less than zero.

For a quadratic equation \(Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0\) to have no real roots, its discriminant must be less than zero. The discriminant \(\Delta\) for the quadratic equation \(x^2 + (a-1)x + 1 = 0\) is given by:

\[
\Delta = (a-1)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = (a-1)^2 - 4
\]

We need \(\Delta < 0\):

\[
(a-1)^2 - 4 < 0 \implies (a-1)^2 < 4 \implies -2 < a-1 < 2 \implies -1 < a < 3
\]

So, the range of the real number \(a\) is \((-1, 3)\).

Let's confirm this with Python and sympy:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variable and the quadratic expression
x, a = sp.symbols('x a')
quadratic_expr = x**2 + (a-1)*x + 1

# Calculate the discriminant of the quadratic expression
discriminant = sp.discriminant(quadratic_expr, x)

# Solve the inequality discriminant < 0
solution = sp.solve(discriminant < 0, a)
print(solution)
```
```output
(-1 < a) & (a < 3)
```
The output confirms our reasoning. The range of the real number \(a\) such that the proposition ""There exists \(x \in \mathbb{R}\), such that \(x^2 + (a-1)x + 1 \leq 0\)"" is false is \((-1, 3)\).

Thus, the range of the real number \(a\) is \(\boxed{(-1, 3)}\).",-0.70625

\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now that we have the constant \( k \), we can use it to find the wind velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P \) on a sail of \( 4 \) square feet is \( 32 \) pounds. The equation now becomes:
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]

\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]
\[ V = 12.6992 \approx 12.7 \text{ miles per hour} \]

","Given:
1. The pressure \( P \) varies jointly as the area \( A \) and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). So, \( P = kA V^3 \), where \( k \) is a constant.
2. When \( V = 8 \) miles per hour and \( A = 2 \) square feet, \( P = 4 \) pounds. We can use this information to find the constant \( k \).
3. We need to find the wind velocity \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet.

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]

\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]

\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now we have the equation \( P = \frac{1}{256} A V^3 \). Next, we need to find \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet:

","To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between pressure \( P \), area \( A \), and wind velocity \( V \). The problem states that the pressure \( P \) varies jointly as the area \( A \) and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). This can be expressed mathematically as:

\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.

","First, let's set up the equation based on the problem statement. The pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). This can be expressed as:
\[ P = k A V^3 \]
where \( k \) is a constant.

Given that when \( V = 8 \) miles per hour, \( A = 2 \) square feet, and \( P = 4 \) pounds, we can find the constant \( k \):
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = 1024k \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ P = \frac{1}{256} A V^3 \]

Now we need to find the wind velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P = 32 \) pounds and the area \( A = 4 \) square feet. Substituting these values into the equation:
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{4 V^3}{256} \]
\[ 32 = \frac{V^3}{64} \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]

We can calculate the cube root of 2048 using Python. Let's do that.

\[
\boxed{12.70}
\]

The sum of two numbers is $12$ and their difference is $20$. What is the larger number? We need to find two numbers whose sum is 12 and whose difference is 20. Let's denote the two numbers as \( x \) and \( y \) with \( x > y \).

We can set up the following system of equations based on the given conditions:
\[ x + y = 12 \]
\[ x - y = 20 \]

To find the values of \( x \) and \( y \), we can add these two equations to eliminate \( y \):
\[ (x + y) + (x - y) = 12 + 20 \]
\[ 2x = 32 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

Now that we have the value of \( x \), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \( y \):
\[ 16 + y = 12 \]
\[ y = 12 - 16 \]
\[ y = -4 \]

So the two numbers are 16 and -4, and the larger number is 16. Let's verify this with Python code to ensure the result is accurate.
```python
# Define the sum and difference of the two numbers
sum_of_numbers = 12
difference_of_numbers = 20

# Calculate the larger number using the equations derived
larger_number = (sum_of_numbers + difference_of_numbers) / 2
print(larger_number)
```
```output

The larger number is \(\boxed{16}\).

If the function $f(x) = (x + 1)(x - a)$ is an even function, then $a =$ (　　)

A: $-2$

B: $-1$

C: $1$

D: $2$ To determine the value of \(a\) that makes the function \(f(x) = (x + 1)(x - a)\) an even function, we need to use the property of even functions. A function \(f(x)\) is even if \(f(x) = f(-x)\) for all \(x\).

Let's follow the steps to find the value of \(a\):

1. Write down the function \(f(x)\):
\[ f(x) = (x + 1)(x - a) \]

2. Substitute \(-x\) into the function to get \(f(-x)\):
\[ f(-x) = (-x + 1)(-x - a) \]

3. Set \(f(x) = f(-x)\) and solve for \(a\):
\[ (x + 1)(x - a) = (-x + 1)(-x - a) \]

Let's expand both sides of the equation:
\[ x^2 + x - ax - a = x^2 - x + ax + a \]
\[ x^2 + x(1 - a) - a = x^2 + x(-1 + a) + a \]

Now, we can simplify by canceling out \(x^2\) from both sides:
\[ x(1 - a) - a = x(-1 + a) + a \]

Next, we can combine like terms:
\[ x(1 - a) - x(-1 + a) = a + a \]
\[ x(1 - a + 1 - a) = 2a \]
\[ x(2 - 2a) = 2a \]

","Given:
- Pressure \( P \) varies jointly as the area \( A \) and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \).
- Initial conditions: \( A = 2 \) square feet, \( V = 8 \) miles per hour, \( P = 4 \) pounds.
- New conditions: \( A = 4 \) square feet, \( P = 32 \) pounds.

First, we express the relationship between \( P \), \( A \), and \( V \) mathematically:
$$ P = k A V^3 $$
where \( k \) is the constant of proportionality.

From the initial conditions, we can find \( k \):
$$ 4 = k \times 2 \times 8^3 $$
$$ 4 = k \times 2 \times 512 $$
$$ 4 = 1024k $$
$$ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} $$

Now, using the new conditions \( A = 4 \) and \( P = 32 \), we can solve for \( V \):
$$ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \times 4 \times V^3 $$
$$ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \times V^3 $$
$$ 32 \times 64 = V^3 $$
$$ 2048 = V^3 $$
$$ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} $$
$$ V = 12.74 $$ (rounded to two decimal places)

Thus, the wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds is approximately \( 12.74 \) miles per hour.

\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.

### Step 1: Determine the constant \( k \)

We are given:
- When \( V = 8 \) mph, \( P = 4 \) pounds, and \( A = 2 \) square feet.

Substitute these values into the equation to find \( k \):

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot (8^3) \]

First, calculate \( 8^3 \):

\[ 8^3 = 512 \]

Now substitute \( 512 \) into the equation:

\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]

Solve for \( k \):

\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} \]
\[ k = \frac{1}{256} \]

### Step 2: Use the constant \( k \) to find the velocity \( V \)

We need to find the wind velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P = 32 \) pounds and the area \( A = 4 \) square feet. Use the equation:

\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

Substitute \( P = 32 \), \( A = 4 \), and \( k = \frac{1}{256} \):

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]

First, simplify the right-hand side:

\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]

To isolate \( V^3 \), multiply both sides by 64:

\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]

Now, solve for \( V \) by taking the cube root of both sides:

\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]

Calculate the cube root:

\[ V = 12.6992 \]

","Given:
- The pressure \( P \) varies jointly as the area \( A \) and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \).
- When \( V = 8 \) miles per hour and \( A = 2 \) square feet, \( P = 4 \) pounds.

We need to find \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet.

First, express the relationship mathematically:
$$
P = kA V^3
$$
where \( k \) is the constant of proportionality.

Using the first set of values (\( P = 4 \), \( A = 2 \), \( V = 8 \)):
$$
4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3
$$
Calculate \( 8^3 \):
$$
8^3 = 512
$$
So the equation becomes:
$$
4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512
$$
Simplify:
$$
4 = k \cdot 1024
$$
Solve for \( k \):
$$
k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256}
$$

Now use this \( k \) to find \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) and \( A = 4 \):
$$
32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3
$$
Simplify the equation:
$$
32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3
$$
$$
32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3
$$
Multiply both sides by 64 to isolate \( V^3 \):
$$
32 \cdot 64 = V^3
$$
$$
2048 = V^3
$$
Take the cube root of both sides to solve for \( V \):
$$
V = \sqrt[3]{2048}
$$
$$
V = 12.699
$$

Thus, the wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds is approximately \( 12.7 \) miles per hour.

- \( A \) is the area of the sail,
- \( V \) is the velocity of the wind,
- \( k \) is the constant of variation.

From the problem, we know:

### Explanation

1. Understanding the Problem: We need to find the wind velocity given the relationship between pressure, area, and velocity. The problem states that the pressure varies jointly with these two quantities.

2. Setting Up the Equation: We use the formula \( P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \) and plug in the known values to find the constant \( k \).

3. Finding the Constant \( k \): By using the given values, we solve for \( k \) and find it to be \( \frac{1}{256} \).

4. Using the Constant: With \( k \) found, we use it to find the new velocity when the pressure is given and the area is increased. This involves solving an equation and understanding the relationship between the variables.

5. Calculating the New Velocity: By plugging in the values and solving the equation \( 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \), we find the new velocity to be approximately \( 12.7 \) miles per hour.

","To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Set up the equation that describes the relationship between the pressure \(P\), the area \(A\), and the wind velocity \(V\). Since the pressure varies jointly with the area and the cube of the wind velocity, we can write:
   \[
   P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3
   \]
   where \(k\) is a constant.

2. Use the given information to find the constant \(k\). When \(V = 8\) mph and \(A = 2\) square feet, \(P = 4\) pounds. So we can write:

   \[
   4 = k \cdot 1024
   \]
   \[
   k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256}
   \]

3. Now we use the constant \(k\) to find the wind velocity \(V\) when the pressure \(P = 32\) pounds and the area \(A = 4\) square feet. So we can write:
   \[
   32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3

The wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is approximately \( \boxed{12.70} \) miles per hour.

If the sum of the first $n$ terms of the sequence ${\_a\_n}$ is represented as $S\_n = \frac{2}{3}a\_n + \frac{1}{3}$, then the general term formula for the sequence ${\_a\_n}$ is $a\_n =$\_\_\_\_\_\_. To solve this problem, we need to find the general term \(a_n\) of the sequence given that the sum of the first \(n\) terms \(S_n = \frac{2}{3}a_n + \frac{1}{3}\).

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Find the first term \(a_1\):**
   When \(n = 1\), we have \(S_1 = a_1\). So, the equation becomes:
   \[
   a_1 = \frac{2}{3}a_1 + \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   Solving for \(a_1\), we get:
   \[
   a_1 - \frac{2}{3}a_1 = \frac{1}{3} \implies \frac{1}{3}a_1 = \frac{1}{3} \implies a_1 = 1
   \]

2. **Find the general term \(a_n\) for \(n \geq 2\):**
   For \(n \geq 2\), we have:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{2}{3}a_n + \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   And also:
   \[
   S_{n-1} = \frac{2}{3}a_{n-1} + \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   Since \(S_n = S_{n-1} + a_n\), we can substitute and get:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}a_n + \frac{1}{3} = \left(\frac{2}{3}a_{n-1} + \frac{1}{3}\right) + a_n
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}a_n + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}a_{n-1} + \frac{1}{3} + a_n \implies \frac{2}{3}a_n - a_n = \frac{2}{3}a_{n-1} \implies -\frac{1}{3}a_n = \frac{2}{3}a_{n-1} \implies a_n = -2a_{n-1}
   \]

3. **General term of the sequence:**
   Since \(a_1 = 1\) and \(a_n = -2a_{n-1}\) for \(n \geq 2\), we can see that the sequence is a geometric sequence with the first term \(a_1 = 1\) and common ratio \(r = -2\). The general term for a geometric sequence is given by:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1} = 1 \cdot (-2)^{n-1} = (-2)^{n-1}
   \]

","To solve this problem, we need to use the given information to find the relationship between pressure \( P \), area \( A \), and velocity \( V \).

Given:
- \( P \) varies jointly as \( A \) and \( V^3 \). This can be expressed as \( P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \), where \( k \) is a constant.
- When \( V = 8 \) miles per hour, \( A = 2 \) square feet, and \( P = 4 \) pounds, we can find the constant \( k \).
- We need to find the velocity \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet.

First, we will find the constant \( k \) using the given values:
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

So the relationship becomes:
\[ P = \frac{1}{256} \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

Next, we use the values \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet to find \( V \):
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]

Let's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.
```python
# Calculate the cube root of 2048
V = 2048 ** (1/3)
print(V)

The wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is approximately \( 12.7 \) miles per hour. Therefore, the final answer is:

If \( a = 3 \) and \( b = -2 \), find the value of \( 4a^2 - 2b + 7 \). Then, if \( c = 5 \), find the value of \( 3c - 4 \). To solve the given problem, we need to evaluate the expression \(4a^2 - 2b + 7\) when \(a = 3\) and \(b = -2\), and then evaluate the expression \(3c - 4\) when \(c = 5\).

Let's break it down into two parts:

1. Evaluate \(4a^2 - 2b + 7\) when \(a = 3\) and \(b = -2\).
2. Evaluate \(3c - 4\) when \(c = 5\).

We'll use Python to ensure the calculations are accurate.
```python
# Given values
a = 3
b = -2
c = 5

# Calculate the value of the first expression
expression1 = 4 * a**2 - 2 * b + 7

# Calculate the value of the second expression
expression2 = 3 * c - 4

print((expression1, expression2))
```
```output
(50, 11)
```
The value of \(4a^2 - 2b + 7\) when \(a = 3\) and \(b = -2\) is \(50\). The value of \(3c - 4\) when \(c = 5\) is \(11\).

So, the final answers are:
\[

In a small town, there are three types of trees: oak, maple, and pine. A local gardener wants to plant trees in a new park, ensuring that the number of oak trees is twice the number of maple trees, and the number of pine trees is three times the number of oak trees. If the total number of trees in the park is 180, how many of each type of tree will the gardener plant? Let's define the variables:
- \( m \) = number of maple trees
- \( o \) = number of oak trees
- \( p \) = number of pine trees

From the problem statement, we have the following relationships:
1. \( o = 2m \)
2. \( p = 3o \)
3. The total number of trees is \( m + o + p = 180 \)

We can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to solve for \( m \):

\[ m + 2m + 3(2m) = 180 \]
\[ m + 2m + 6m = 180 \]
\[ 9m = 180 \]
\[ m = 20 \]

Now we can find \( o \) and \( p \):

\[ o = 2m = 2(20) = 40 \]
\[ p = 3o = 3(40) = 120 \]

So the number of maple trees is 20, the number of oak trees is 40, and the number of pine trees is 120. Let's verify this with Python code to ensure the result is accurate.
```python

m = 180 // 9

If a number is chosen at random from the set of all positive integers between 1 and 20, what is the probability that the number is the square of a Fibonacci number? Express your answer as a common fraction. To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a number chosen at random from the set of all positive integers between 1 and 20 is the square of a Fibonacci number. Let's break down the solution into the following steps:

1. Identify the Fibonacci numbers that, when squared, are less than or equal to 20.
2. List the squares of these Fibonacci numbers.
3. Determine the total number of integers between 1 and 20.
4. Calculate the probability as the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes.

### Step 1: Identify Fibonacci numbers and their squares

The Fibonacci sequence starts with 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ... We need to consider only those Fibonacci numbers whose squares are less than or equal to 20. The Fibonacci numbers are: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ... and their squares are: 1, 1, 4, 9, 25, 64, 169, ... respectively. The squares of Fibonacci numbers that are less than or equal to 20 are: 1, 1, 4, and 9. This gives us the numbers 1, 1, 4, and 9.

### Step 2: List the squares of these Fibonacci numbers

The numbers that are the square of a Fibonacci number are 1, 1, 4, and 9. So there are 4 such numbers.

### Step 3: Determine the total number of integers between 1 and 20

There are 20 integers between 1 and 20.

### Step 4: Calculate the probability

The probability that a number chosen at random from the set of all positive integers between 1 and 20 is the square of a Fibonacci number is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (4) to the total number of outcomes (20). This gives us the probability as $\frac{4}{20} = \frac{1}{5}$.

Let's confirm this with Python code.
```python
# Define the Fibonacci numbers whose squares are less than or equal to 20
fibonacci_squares = [1, 1, 4, 9]

# Total number of integers between 1 and 20
total_numbers = 20

# Number of favorable outcomes
favorable_outcomes = len(fibonacci_squares)

# Probability calculation
probability = favorable_outcomes / total_numbers
print(probability)
```
```output
0.2
```
The probability that a number chosen at random from the set of all positive integers between 1 and 20 is the square of a Fibonacci number is $\frac{1}{5}$ or 0.2. 

So the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{5}}

","First, we start by setting up the joint variation model:
\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

1. Determine the constant \( k \):
   - Given \( P = 4 \) pounds, \( A = 2 \) square feet, and \( V = 8 \) miles per hour, we substitute these values into the equation to find \( k \):
   \[
   4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3
   \]
   \[
   4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512
   \]
   \[
   4 = k \cdot 1024
   \]
   \[
   k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256}
   \]

2. Find the wind velocity when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet:
   - Using the value of \( k \) we found, substitute \( P = 32 \) pounds, \( A = 4 \) square feet into the equation:
   \[
   32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3
   \]
   \[
   32 = \frac{4V^3}{256}
   \]
   \[
   32 \cdot 256 = 4V^3
   \]
   \[
   8192 = 4V^3
   \]
   \[
   V^3 = \frac{8192}{4} = 2048
   \]
   \[
   V = \sqrt[3]{2048}
   \]

3. Calculate the cube root of 2048:
   - The cube root of 2048 can be simplified as follows:
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{2048} = \sqrt[3]{2^{11}} = 2^{\frac{11}{3}} = 2^3 \cdot 2^{\frac{2}{3}} = 8 \cdot \sqrt[3]{4}
   \]

Thus, the wind velocity \( V \) when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds is:
\[
V = 8 \cdot \sqrt[3]{4} \text{ miles per hour}
\]

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8 \cdot \sqrt[3]{4} \text{ miles per hour}}

In the coordinate plane, consider a triangle \( \Delta ABC \) with vertices \( A(1, 2) \), \( B(4, 6) \), and \( C(6, 2) \). 

1. Geometry: Determine the area of triangle \( \Delta ABC \) using the coordinates of its vertices.
2. Algebra: Find the equation of the line passing through the midpoint of side \( AB \) and the point \( C \).
3. Statistics: If another point \( D \) is randomly chosen within the triangle such that its coordinates are \( (x, y) \), calculate the probability that \( D \) lies below the line you found in part 2. 1. Geometry:
   To find the area of \( \Delta ABC \), we use the formula for the area of a triangle given vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\):
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
   \]
   Substituting the coordinates of \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \):
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 1(6 - 2) + 4(2 - 2) + 6(2 - 6) \right|
   \]
   Simplifying inside the absolute value:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 1 \cdot 4 + 4 \cdot 0 + 6 \cdot (-4) \right|
   \]
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 4 - 24 \right|
   \]
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| -20 \right|
   \]
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 20 = 10
   \]
   So, the area of \( \Delta ABC \) is \( 10 \) square units.

2. Algebra:
   To find the equation of the line passing through the midpoint of \( AB \) and point \( C \):
   First, find the midpoint \( M \) of \( AB \):
   \[
   M = \left( \frac{1+4}{2}, \frac{2+6}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{5}{2}, 4 \right)

   The slope of the line through \( M \) and \( C(6, 2) \) is:
   \[
   m = \frac{2 - 4}{6 - \frac{5}{2}} = \frac{-2}{\frac{7}{2}} = -\frac{4}{7}

","To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of joint variation. The pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). This can be expressed mathematically as:

\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.

First, we need to find the constant \( k \). We are given that when \( V = 8 \) miles per hour, \( A = 2 \) square feet, and \( P = 4 \) pounds. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ P = \frac{1}{256} \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

Now we need to find the wind velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P = 32 \) pounds and the area \( A = 4 \) square feet. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

","Given the joint variation, we can express the relationship as \( P = kA V^3 \), where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.

1. Determine the constant of proportionality \( k \):

   Given: \( P = 4 \) pounds, \( A = 2 \) square feet, \( V = 8 \) miles per hour.

   Plugging these values into the equation:

   \[
   4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3
   \]

   Simplify the right-hand side:

   \[
   4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512
   \]

   \[
   4 = k \cdot 1024
   \]

   Solve for \( k \):

   \[
   k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256}
   \]

2. Find the wind velocity \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet:

   Using the value of \( k \) we found:

   \[
   P = \frac{1}{256} A V^3
   \]

   Substitute \( P = 32 \) and \( A = 4 \):

   \[
   32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3
   \]

   Simplify the right-hand side:

   \[
   32 = \frac{4V^3}{256}
   \]

   Multiply both sides by 256 to clear the fraction:

   \[
   32 \cdot 256 = 4V^3
   \]

   \[
   8192 = 4V^3
   \]

   Divide both sides by 4:

   \[
   2048 = V^3
   \]

   Take the cube root of both sides to solve for \( V \):

   \[
   V = \sqrt[3]{2048}
   \]

   Simplify the cube root:

   \[
   V = 16 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Thus, the wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds is \( 16 \) miles per hour. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality, \( A \) is the area of the sail, and \( V \) is the velocity of the wind.

Step 1: Determine the constant \( k \).

We know that when \( V = 8 \) mph and \( A = 2 \) sq ft, the pressure \( P = 4 \) pounds. Substituting these values into the equation:

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]

Calculate \( 8^3 \):

Now, solve for \( k \):

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = 1024k \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} \]
\[ k = \frac{1}{256} \]

Step 2: Use the constant \( k \) to find the wind velocity when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) sq ft.

Substitute \( P = 32 \), \( A = 4 \), and \( k = \frac{1}{256} \) into the equation:

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]

Simplify the equation:

To isolate \( V^3 \), multiply both sides by \( 64 \):

where \( k \) is the constant of proportionality.

First, we need to find the constant \( k \) using the given information. When the velocity \( V = 8 \) miles per hour and the area \( A = 2 \) square feet, the pressure \( P = 4 \) pounds. Plugging these values into the formula gives us:

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]

Now, we calculate \( 8^3 \):

\[ 8^3 = 8 \cdot 8 \cdot 8 = 512 \]

Substituting \( 512 \) back into the equation:

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]

To find \( k \), we divide both sides by \( 1024 \):

\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now that we have the constant \( k \), we can use it to find the wind velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P = 32 \) pounds and the area \( A = 4 \) square feet. Plugging these values into the formula gives us:

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]

First, we calculate \( \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \):

\[ \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 = \frac{4}{256} = \frac{1}{64} \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]

To find \( V^3 \), we multiply both sides by \( 64 \):

\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]

Now, we find \( V \) by taking the cube root of \( 2048 \):

\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]

We can simplify \( \sqrt[3]{2048} \) by recognizing that \( 2048 = 2^{11} \):

\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2^{11}} = 2^{\frac{11}{3}} = 2^3 \cdot 2^{\frac{2}{3}} = 8 \cdot \sqrt[3]{4} \]

Since we are dealing with practical applications and this is a simplified solution, we can approximate \( \sqrt[3]{4} \approx 1.587 \):

\[ V \approx 8 \cdot 1.587 \approx 12.7 \]

$$ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 $$
$$ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 $$
Multiplying both sides by 64 to isolate \( V^3 \):
$$ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 $$
$$ 2048 = V^3 $$
Taking the cube root of both sides to solve for \( V \):
$$ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} $$
$$ V = 8 $$

","To solve this problem, we need to use the given information to find the constant of proportionality \( k \) and then use that constant to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a 4 square foot sail is 32 pounds.

The pressure \( P \) is given by the formula:
\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

We are given:
- When \( V = 8 \) miles per hour and \( A = 2 \) square feet, \( P = 4 \) pounds.
- We need to find \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet.

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now we can use this constant \( k \) to find the wind velocity \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet:
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]

","Given that the pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \), we can write the relationship as:

\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.

First, we need to find the constant \( k \). We know that when \( V = 8 \) miles per hour, \( A = 2 \) square feet, and \( P = 4 \) pounds. Plugging these values into the equation gives:

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]

Solving for \( k \), we get:

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} \]
\[ k = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now that we have the constant \( k \), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds. We set up the equation:

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]

Solving for \( V \):

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]

Taking the cube root of both sides:

\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]

To simplify the cube root, we find the prime factorization of \( 2048 \):

\[ 2048 = 2^{11} \]

The cube root of \( 2048 \) is:

\[ V = 2^{3 + \frac{2}{3}} \]
\[ V = 2^3 \cdot 2^{\frac{2}{3}} \]
\[ V = 8 \cdot \sqrt[3]{4} \]

Therefore, the wind velocity is:

\[ V = 8 \cdot \sqrt[3]{4} \]

To output the final answer within \boxed{}, we calculate the numerical value of \( \sqrt[3]{4} \) and then multiply by 8:

Calculate \( 8^3 \):

\[ V = 12.699236612750118 \approx 12.70 \]

The solutions to the equation are approximately \( 12.70 \), \(-6.35 - 10.91i \), and \(-6.35 + 10.91i \). Since the velocity of the wind must be a real number, the valid solution is \( 12.70 \).

","Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Understand the relationship: The pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). This can be expressed as:
\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]
where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.

2. Use the given information to find the constant \( k \):
When \( V = 8 \) mph and \( A = 2 \) square feet, \( P = 4 \) pounds. So we can write:
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]
Solving for \( k \):
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

3. Use the constant \( k \) to find the wind velocity \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet:
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
Solving for \( V \):
\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]
\[ V = 8 \]

So, the wind velocity is \( 8 \) mph. Let's confirm this by coding the solution in Python.
```python
# Given values
P1 = 4  # pressure in pounds
A1 = 2  # area in square feet
V1 = 8  # velocity in mph

# Calculate the constant k

# New values
P2 = 32  # pressure in pounds
A2 = 4  # area in square feet

# Calculate the new velocity V2
V2 = (P2 / (k * A2))**(1/3)

   \[
   P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3

3. **Find the Wind Velocity When \(P = 32\) and \(A = 4\):**

","## The Pressure Problem
The problem states that the pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). This can be written as:
\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]
where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.

We are given that when \( V = 8 \) miles per hour and \( A = 2 \) square feet, the pressure \( P \) is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the constant \( k \):

\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]
Now that we have the constant \( k \), we can use it to find the wind velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P \) is 32 pounds and the area \( A \) is 4 square feet:
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
First, let's calculate \( \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \):

Given $f(x)= \begin{cases} x-2,(x\geqslant 10) \\ f(x+6),(x < 10) \end{cases}$, find the value of $f(5)$. To find the value of \( f(5) \) given the piecewise function \( f(x) \), we need to follow the rules of the function. The function is defined as:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} 
x - 2 & \text{if } x \geq 10 \\ 
f(x + 6) & \text{if } x < 10

Since \( 5 < 10 \), we need to use the second part of the piecewise function, which means we need to evaluate \( f(5 + 6) = f(11) \). Since \( 11 \geq 10 \), we can use the first part of the piecewise function, which means \( f(11) = 11 - 2 = 9 \).

Therefore, \( f(5) = f(11) = 9 \).

","To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of joint variation. The pressure \( P \) varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). This means that \( P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \) for some constant \( k \).

We are given:
1. \( P = 4 \) pounds when \( A = 2 \) square feet and \( V = 8 \) miles per hour.
2. We need to find \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet.

First, we need to find the constant \( k \). We can use the given values to solve for \( k \):

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]

Solving for \( k \):

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now we have the equation \( P = \frac{1}{256} \cdot A \cdot V^3 \). We can use this to find the velocity \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet:

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]

We can now calculate the cube root of 2048 to find the value of \( V \). Let's do this using Python.

","## Step-by-Step Solution

Given that the pressure \( P \) varies jointly as the area \( A \) and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \), we can write this relationship as:
\[ P = kA V^3 \]
where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.

1. **Find the Constant \( k \)**:
   - Given:
     \[ A = 2 \text{ square feet}, \quad V = 8 \text{ miles per hour}, \quad P = 4 \text{ pounds} \]
   - Plug these values into the equation to solve for \( k \):
     \[
     4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3
     \]
     \[
     4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512
     \]
     \[
     4 = 1024k
     \]
     \[
     k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256}
     \]

2. **Use the Constant \( k \) to Find \( V \) When \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet**:
   - Substitute \( k \), \( A \), and \( P \) into the equation:
     \[
     32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3
     \]
     \[
     32 = \frac{4V^3}{256}
     \]
     \[
     32 \cdot 256 = 4V^3
     \]
     \[
     8192 = 4V^3
     \]
     \[
     V^3 = \frac{8192}{4} = 2048
     \]
     \[
     V = \sqrt[3]{2048}
     \]

3. **Calculate \( V \)**:
   - Compute the cube root of 2048:
     \[
     V = \sqrt[3]{2048} = 12.6818
     \]

Thus, the wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds is approximately \( 12.68 \) miles per hour.

Let's confirm this with Python code for accuracy.

The wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds is approximately \( 12.69 \) miles per hour.

Thus, the final answer is:

The minimum positive period of the function $f(x)=\sin x\cdot(4\cos ^{2}x-1)$ is (　　).
A: $ \dfrac {\pi}{3}$
B: $ \dfrac {2\pi}{3}$
C: $\pi$
D: $2\pi$ To find the minimum positive period of the function \( f(x) = \sin x \cdot (4\cos^2 x - 1) \), we need to determine the smallest positive value \( T \) such that \( f(x + T) = f(x) \) for all \( x \).

First, let's simplify the expression for \( f(x) \):

\[ f(x) = \sin x \cdot (4\cos^2 x - 1) \]

We can use the double-angle identity for cosine, which states that \( \cos 2x = 2\cos^2 x - 1 \). So, we can rewrite \( 4\cos^2 x - 1 \) as \( 2(2\cos^2 x - 1) + 1 = 2\cos 2x + 1 \). Therefore, the function becomes:

\[ f(x) = \sin x \cdot (2\cos 2x + 1) = 2\sin x \cos 2x + \sin x \]

Now, we need to find the period of \( f(x) \). Since both \( \sin x \) and \( \cos 2x \) are periodic functions with periods \( 2\pi \) and \( \pi \) respectively, the function \( f(x) \) will be periodic with a period that is the least common multiple (LCM) of these periods.

The period of \( \sin x \) is \( 2\pi \) and the period of \( \cos 2x \) is \( \pi \). The LCM of \( 2\pi \) and \( \pi \) is \( 2\pi \), but since the function \( f(x) \) includes \( \sin x \), which has a period of \( 2\pi \), we need to check if there is a smaller period that satisfies the function.

","Given:
- The pressure \( P \) varies jointly as the area \( A \) and the cube of the velocity \( V \). This can be written as:
  $$ P = kAV^3 $$

Step 1: Determine the constant \( k \)

We know when \( A = 2 \) square feet and \( V = 8 \) miles per hour, \( P = 4 \) pounds. Substitute these values into the equation:
$$ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 $$
Calculate \( 8^3 \):

$$ 4 = k \cdot 1024 $$
Solve for \( k \):
$$ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} $$

Step 2: Use the constant \( k \) to find the velocity \( V \)

Now, we need to find \( V \) when \( A = 4 \) square feet and \( P = 32 \) pounds. Substitute these values into the equation:
$$ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 $$

Multiply both sides by 64:
$$ 2048 = V^3 $$
Take the cube root of both sides:
$$ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} $$
Calculate the cube root:
$$ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} = 12.8 \text{ miles per hour} $$

The pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). When the velocity is \( 8 \) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \( 2 \) square feet is \( 4 \) pounds.

","First, we need to set up the equation based on the given information. The pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail is given by the formula:

\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

where \( k \) is a constant, \( A \) is the area of the sail, and \( V \) is the wind's velocity. 

From the problem, we know:
1. When \( V = 8 \) mph, \( A = 2 \) square feet, and \( P = 4 \) pounds.
2. We need to find \( V \) when \( A = 4 \) square feet and \( P = 32 \) pounds.

First, we'll find the constant \( k \) using the given values:

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]

Solving for \( k \):

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now we use this constant \( k \) to find the velocity \( V \) when \( A = 4 \) square feet and \( P = 32 \) pounds:

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]

Let's calculate the cube root of 2048 using Python.
```python

","Given:
- \( P \propto A V^3 \)
- \( P_1 = 4 \) pounds, \( A_1 = 2 \) square feet, \( V_1 = 8 \) miles per hour
- \( P_2 = 32 \) pounds, \( A_2 = 4 \) square feet, \( V_2 = \) ?

Using the proportionality \( P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \), we can find \( k \) from the given conditions:

\[
4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3
\]

\[

\[
4 = k \cdot 1024

Now, using \( k \) and the second condition:

\]

\[
32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V_2^3

\[

Problem:

Consider a function \( f(x) \) defined on the interval \([0, 1]\) such that \( f(x) \) takes the value \( n \) for \( \frac{1}{n+1} \leq x < \frac{1}{n} \) for \( n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots \). Determine the value of the following integral:

$$ \int_0^1 f(x) \, dx $$ To solve this problem, we start by analyzing the function \( f(x) \). The function \( f(x) \) takes the value \( n \) for the interval \( \left[ \frac{1}{n+1}, \frac{1}{n} \right) \) for each positive integer \( n \). 

We need to evaluate the integral:

$$ \int_0^1 f(x) \, dx $$

We can break this integral into the sum of integrals over each interval where \( f(x) \) is constant:

$$ \int_0^1 f(x) \, dx = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \int_{\frac{1}{n+1}}^{\frac{1}{n}} n \, dx $$

Now, we evaluate each integral:

$$ \int_{\frac{1}{n+1}}^{\frac{1}{n}} n \, dx = n \left[ x \right]_{\frac{1}{n+1}}^{\frac{1}{n}} = n \left( \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1} \right) $$

Simplifying the expression:

$$ n \left( \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1} \right) = n \left( \frac{n+1 - n}{n(n+1)} \right) = \frac{n}{n(n+1)} = \frac{1}{n+1} $$

Thus, the integral becomes:

$$ \int_0^1 f(x) \, dx = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n+1} $$

This series can be rewritten by shifting the index of summation:

$$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n+1} = \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n} $$

The series \( \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n} \) is a p-series with \( p = 1 \), which is known to diverge. Hence, the integral:

$$ \int_0^1 f(x) \, dx $$

diverges.

Therefore, the value of the integral is:

$$ \boxed{\infty} $$

Consider a function $f(x)$ defined on the interval $[0, 2]$ such that $f(0) = 0$ and $f(2) = 2$. Suppose $f(x)$ is twice continuously differentiable on $[0, 2]$ and satisfies the differential equation:

$$f''(x) + 4f(x) = 0$$

with boundary conditions:

$$f(0) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad f(2) = 2.$$

Determine the function $f(x)$ that satisfies these conditions. To solve the given boundary value problem, we first recognize that the differential equation $f''(x) + 4f(x) = 0$ is a homogeneous linear differential equation with constant coefficients. The general solution to this type of differential equation can be expressed as a linear combination of two linearly independent solutions.

The characteristic equation associated with this differential equation is:

$$r^2 + 4 = 0$$

Solving for $r$, we get:

$$r = \pm 2i$$

Thus, the general solution to the differential equation is:

$$f(x) = C_1 \cos(2x) + C_2 \sin(2x)$$

","To solve the problem, we need to use the given information to determine the relationship between the pressure \( P \), the area \( A \), and the velocity \( V \). The problem states that the pressure \( P \) varies jointly as the area \( A \) and the cube of the velocity \( V \). This means we can write the relationship as:

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
