When the velocity is \( 8 \) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \( 2 \) square feet is \( 4 \) pounds.

","Given:
\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

From the problem, we have:
\[ P_1 = 4 \text{ pounds}, \quad A_1 = 2 \text{ square feet}, \quad V_1 = 8 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ P_2 = 32 \text{ pounds}, \quad A_2 = 4 \text{ square feet}, \quad V_2 = ? \]

We need to find \( V_2 \).

First, we find the constant \( k \) using the given values:
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = 1024k \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} \]
\[ k = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now, we use this \( k \) to find \( V_2 \):
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V_2^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{4V_2^3}{256} \]
\[ 32 \cdot 256 = 4V_2^3 \]
\[ 8192 = 4V_2^3 \]
\[ V_2^3 = \frac{8192}{4} \]
\[ V_2^3 = 2048 \]
\[ V_2 = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]
\[ V_2 = 12.8 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, the wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds is \( 12.8 \) miles per hour.

","The pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail is directly proportional to both the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). Therefore, we can express the relationship as:
\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]
where \( k \) is the constant of proportionality.

Given:
- When \( V = 8 \) mph, \( P = 4 \) pounds, and \( A = 2 \) square feet.
- We need to find \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet.

First, we'll determine the constant \( k \) using the given values:
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now, we'll use this constant \( k \) to find the wind velocity \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet:
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]
\[ V = 12.699 \text{ mph (approximately)} \]

","To solve this problem, we'll use the given information to set up an equation that represents the relationship between the pressure \( P \), the area \( A \), and the velocity \( V \). The relationship is given as \( P = kAV^3 \), where \( k \) is the constant of proportionality. We can use the given values to find \( k \) and then use it to find the velocity when the pressure on a \( 4 \) square feet sail is \( 32 \) pounds.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Use the given values to find the constant \( k \).
2. Use the constant \( k \) to find the velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P \) is 32 pounds and the area \( A \) is 4 square feet.

Let's start by finding the constant \( k \) using the given values \( P = 4 \) pounds, \( A = 2 \) square feet, and \( V = 8 \) miles per hour.
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now that we have the constant \( k \), we can use it to find the velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P \) is 32 pounds and the area \( A \) is 4 square feet.
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]
\[ V = 8 \sqrt[3]{4} \]

\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

4. Now we need to find the wind velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P = 32 \) pounds and the area \( A = 4 \) square feet. We can use the equation with the constant \( k \) we just found:
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{4 \cdot V^3}{256} \]
\[ 32 = \frac{V^3}{64} \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]
\[ V = 12.6992 \]

Since we are dealing with a physical quantity, we should round to a reasonable number of decimal places. In this case, we can round to the nearest whole number, so \( V = 13 \) miles per hour.

Let's verify this using Python to ensure accuracy.
```python
# Given values
P1 = 4  # pressure in pounds
A1 = 2  # area in square feet
V1 = 8  # velocity in miles per hour

# Calculate the constant k
k = P1 / (A1 * V1**3)

# New values
P2 = 32  # pressure in pounds
A2 = 4  # area in square feet

# Calculate the new velocity V
V2 = (P2 / k) ** (1/3)
V2_rounded = round(V2)

print(V2_rounded)
```
```output
13
```
The wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds is \(\boxed{13}\) miles per hour."

","To solve this problem, we need to use the given information to find the constant of proportionality \( k \) and then use that constant to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a 4 square foot sail is 32 pounds.

The pressure \( P \) is given by the formula:
\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

We are given:
- When \( V = 8 \) miles per hour and \( A = 2 \) square feet, \( P = 4 \) pounds.
- We need to find \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet.

First, let's find the constant \( k \) using the given values:
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now we can use this constant \( k \) to find the wind velocity \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet:
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]

Let's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.
```python
# Given values
P1 = 4  # pounds
A1 = 2  # square feet
V1 = 8  # miles per hour

P2 = 32  # pounds
A2 = 4  # square feet

# Calculate the constant k
k = P1 / (A1 * V1**3)

# Calculate the wind velocity V2
V2 = (P2 / (A2 * k))**(1/3)
print(V2)
```
```output

","Given:
- The pressure \( P \) varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). This can be represented mathematically as \( P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \) where \( k \) is the constant of proportionality.

From the problem, we know that when \( V = 8 \) mph and \( A = 2 \) square feet, the pressure \( P = 4 \) pounds. We can use this information to find the constant \( k \):

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

So, the equation becomes \( P = \frac{1}{256} \cdot A \cdot V^3 \).

Now, we need to find the wind velocity \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet. Substituting these values into the equation:

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]

Let's calculate the cube root of 2048 using Python to ensure accuracy.
```python
import math

# Given values
P = 32
A = 4

# Constant k
k = 1 / 256

# Equation to solve: P = k * A * V^3
# Rearrange to solve for V: V = (P / (k * A))^(1/3)
V_cubed = P / (k * A)
V = V_cubed ** (1/3)

print(V)
```
```output
12.699208415745596
```
The wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds is approximately \( 12.7 \) miles per hour. Therefore, the final answer is:

","Given:
1. The pressure \( P \) varies jointly as the area \( A \) and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). So, \( P = kA V^3 \), where \( k \) is a constant.
2. When \( V = 8 \) miles per hour and \( A = 2 \) square feet, \( P = 4 \) pounds. We can use this information to find the constant \( k \).
3. We need to find the wind velocity \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet.

First, let's find the constant \( k \):

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]

\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]

\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now we have the equation \( P = \frac{1}{256} A V^3 \). Next, we need to find \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet:

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]

\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} V^3 \]

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} V^3 \]

\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]

\[ 2048 = V^3 \]

\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]

Now let's calculate the value of \( V \).

So, the final answer is:
