","### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   The pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). This can be expressed mathematically as:
   \[
   P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3
   \]
   where \( k \) is a constant.

2. **Find the Constant \( k \):**
   Given that when \( V = 8 \) miles per hour, \( P = 4 \) pounds, and \( A = 2 \) square feet, we can substitute these values into the equation to find \( k \):
   \[
   4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3
   \]
   Simplifying the right-hand side:
   \[
   4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 = k \cdot 1024
   \]
   Solving for \( k \):
   \[
   k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256}
   \]

3. **Find the Wind Velocity \( V \):**
   We are given that when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet, we need to find \( V \). Substituting these values and the constant \( k \) into the equation:
   \[
   32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3
   \]
   Simplifying the right-hand side:
   \[
   32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3
   \]
   Solving for \( V^3 \):
   \[
   32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \implies 2048 = V^3
   \]
   Taking the cube root of both sides:
   \[
   V = \sqrt[3]{2048}
   \]

Let's calculate the cube root of 2048 using Python to ensure accuracy.
```python
# Calculate the cube root of 2048
V = 2048 ** (1/3)
print(V)
```
```output
12.699208415745593
```
The wind velocity \( V \) when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is approximately \( 12.70 \) miles per hour. Therefore, the final answer is:

","To solve the problem, we need to use the given information to determine the relationship between the pressure \( P \), the area \( A \), and the velocity \( V \). The problem states that the pressure \( P \) varies jointly as the area \( A \) and the cube of the velocity \( V \). This means we can write the relationship as:

\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

where \( k \) is a constant.

First, we use the given values to find the constant \( k \):

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]

From this, we can solve for \( k \):

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now we know the constant \( k \). We can use this to find the velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P \) is 32 pounds and the area \( A \) is 4 square feet:

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]

Let's calculate the value of \( V \):

\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]

Calculate \( 8^3 \):

\[ 8^3 = 512 \]

So, the equation becomes:

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]

Simplify the equation to solve for \( k \):

\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} \]
\[ k = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now that we have the value of \( k \), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a \( 4 \) square foot sail is \( 32 \) pounds. Substitute \( k = \frac{1}{256} \), \( P = 32 \), and \( A = 4 \) into the equation:

Simplify the equation:

Multiply both sides by \( 64 \) to solve for \( V^3 \):

\[ 2048 = V^3 \]

Take the cube root of both sides to find \( V \):

\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]

We know that \( 2048 = 2^{11} \):

The pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). When the velocity is \( 8 \) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \( 2 \) square feet is \( 4 \) pounds.

","To solve the problem, we need to use the given information to determine the constant of proportionality and then use that to find the wind velocity when the pressure on a 4 square feet sail is 32 pounds.

The relationship given is that the pressure \( P \) varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). This can be written as:
\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]
where \( k \) is the constant of proportionality.

First, we need to find the value of \( k \) using the given information that when \( V = 8 \) mph, \( A = 2 \) square feet, and \( P = 4 \) pounds. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now that we have the value of \( k \), we can use it to find the wind velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P \) on a 4 square feet sail is 32 pounds. Substituting \( P = 32 \), \( A = 4 \), and \( k = \frac{1}{256} \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]

We can calculate the cube root of 2048 to find the value of \( V \). Let's use Python to do this calculation.
```python
import math

# Calculate the cube root of 2048
V = 2048 ** (1/3)
print(V)
```
```output
12.699208415745594
```
The cube root of 2048 is approximately 12.70. Therefore, the wind velocity \( V \) when the pressure on a 4 square feet sail is 32 pounds is approximately \( 12.70 \) miles per hour.

So the final answer is:

","First, we need to understand the relationship described: the pressure \( P \) varies jointly with the area \( A \) and the cube of the velocity \( V \). This can be written as:
\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]
where \( k \) is a constant.

Given:
1. When \( V = 8 \) mph and \( A = 2 \) square feet, \( P = 4 \) pounds.
2. We need to find \( V \) when \( A = 4 \) square feet and \( P = 32 \) pounds.

Let's first find the constant \( k \). Substitute the given values into the equation:
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]
Solving for \( k \):
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now we have the equation:
\[ P = \frac{1}{256} \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

Next, we substitute the given values to find \( V \):
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
Solving for \( V \):
\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]
\[ V = 12.6992 \approx 12.7 \text{ mph} \]

Let's use Python to ensure the result is accurate.

","The pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). This can be expressed as:

\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

where \( k \) is a constant.

First, we need to find the constant \( k \). Given that when \( V = 8 \) mph, \( A = 2 \) square feet, and \( P = 4 \) pounds, we can substitute these values into the equation to find \( k \):

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now that we have the constant \( k \), we can use it to find the wind velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P \) on a sail of \( 4 \) square feet is \( 32 \) pounds. Substituting \( P = 32 \), \( A = 4 \), and \( k = \frac{1}{256} \) into the equation:

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]
\[ V = 12.699 \approx 12.7 \text{ mph} \]

So, the wind velocity is approximately \( 12.7 \) miles per hour. Let's confirm this with Python code.
```python
# Given values
P1 = 4  # pounds
A1 = 2  # square feet
V1 = 8  # miles per hour

# Calculate the constant k
k = P1 / (A1 * V1**3)

# New values

The calculated wind velocity when the pressure on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds is approximately \( 12.7 \) miles per hour. Therefore, the final answer is:

","To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of joint variation. The pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail is given by the formula:

\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

where \( k \) is a constant, \( A \) is the area of the sail, and \( V \) is the wind's velocity.

We are given that when \( V = 8 \) miles per hour, \( P = 4 \) pounds, and \( A = 2 \) square feet. We can use this information to find the constant \( k \):

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now we know the constant \( k \). Next, we need to find the wind velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P \) is 32 pounds and the area \( A \) is 4 square feet. We can use the formula:

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]
\[ V = 8 \sqrt[3]{4} \]

Since \(\sqrt[3]{4} \approx 1.587\), we have:

","Given that the pressure \( P \) varies jointly with the area \( A \) and the cube of the velocity \( V \), we can express this relationship as:

$$ P = kA V^3 $$

where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.

First, we need to find the constant \( k \) using the given values. When \( P = 4 \) pounds, \( A = 2 \) square feet, and \( V = 8 \) miles per hour:

$$ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 $$

Calculate \( 8^3 \):

$$ 8^3 = 512 $$

So, the equation becomes:

$$ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 $$

Simplify and solve for \( k \):

$$ 4 = 1024k $$
$$ k = \frac{4}{1024} $$
$$ k = \frac{1}{256} $$

Now we have the relationship:

$$ P = \frac{1}{256} A V^3 $$

Next, we use this relationship to find the wind velocity \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet:

$$ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 $$

Simplify the equation:

$$ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 $$
$$ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 $$

Multiply both sides by \( 64 \) to isolate \( V^3 \):

$$ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 $$
$$ 2048 = V^3 $$

To solve for \( V \), take the cube root of both sides:

$$ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} $$

Calculate the cube root:

$$ V = 12.4072 \text{ miles per hour (approx.)} $$

Therefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds is approximately \( 12.41 \) miles per hour. So, the final answer is:

$$ \boxed{12.41} $$

Consider a function \( f(x) \) defined on the interval \([0, 2\pi]\) by \( f(x) = \cos(x) + \sin(x) \). Let \( a_n \) and \( b_n \) be the Fourier coefficients of \( f(x) \), given by:

\[ a_n = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{0}^{2\pi} f(x) \cos(nx) \, dx \]
\[ b_n = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{0}^{2\pi} f(x) \sin(nx) \, dx \]

1. Find the Fourier coefficients \( a_n \) and \( b_n \).
2. Determine the sum \( S = \sum_{n=1}^{N} (a_n^2 + b_n^2) \) for \( N = 3 \). Step 1: Compute \( a_n \) and \( b_n \)

First, we need to compute \( a_n \) and \( b_n \) for the given function \( f(x) = \cos(x) + \sin(x) \).

For \( a_n \):

\[ a_n = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{0}^{2\pi} (\cos(x) + \sin(x)) \cos(nx) \, dx \]

Using the orthogonality of trigonometric functions:

\[ \int_{0}^{2\pi} \cos(x) \cos(nx) \, dx = \begin{cases} 
\pi & \text{if } n = 1 \\
0 & \text{otherwise} 
\end{cases} \]

\[ \int_{0}^{2\pi} \sin(x) \cos(nx) \, dx = 0 \]

Thus, \( a_n = \frac{1}{\pi} \left( \pi \delta_{n1} + 0 \right) = \delta_{n1} \), where \( \delta_{n1} \) is the Kronecker delta function.

For \( b_n \):

\[ b_n = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{0}^{2\pi} (\cos(x) + \sin(x)) \sin(nx) \, dx \]

Using the orthogonality of trigonometric functions:

\[ \int_{0}^{2\pi} \cos(x) \sin(nx) \, dx = 0 \]
\[ \int_{0}^{2\pi} \sin(x) \sin(nx) \, dx = \begin{cases} 
\pi & \text{if } n = 1 \\
0 & \text{otherwise} 
\end{cases} \]

Thus, \( b_n = \frac{1}{\pi} \left( 0 + \pi \delta_{n1} \right) = \delta_{n1} \).

Step 2: Determine the sum \( S \)

We need to compute \( S = \sum_{n=1}^{N} (a_n^2 + b_n^2) \) for \( N = 3 \).

For \( N = 3 \):

\[ S = \sum_{n=1}^{3} (a_n^2 + b_n^2) \]

Since \( a_n = \delta_{n1} \) and \( b_n = \delta_{n1} \):

\[ S = \sum_{n=1}^{3} (\delta_{n1}^2 + \delta_{n1}^2) \]

Since \( \delta"

","Step 1: Understand the relationship between pressure, area, and wind velocity.

The pressure \( P \) varies jointly as the area \( A \) and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). This relationship can be expressed as:
\[ P = k A V^3 \]
where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.

Step 2: Find the constant \( k \) using the given information.

Given:

Substitute these values into the equation to solve for \( k \):

The pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). When the velocity is \( 8 \) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \( 2 \) square feet is \( 4 \) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{}.<|im_end|>

","Given:
- The pressure \( P \) varies jointly as the area \( A \) and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \).
- When \( V = 8 \) miles per hour and \( A = 2 \) square feet, \( P = 4 \) pounds.
- We need to find the velocity \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet.

First, let's express the relationship mathematically:
\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]
where \( k \) is a constant.

From the given data:
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]

Let's solve for \( k \):
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now, we use this constant \( k \) to find the velocity \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet:
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]

Let's solve for \( V \):
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]

We'll calculate this value using Python to ensure accuracy.
```python
import sympy as sp

# Given constants
P = 32
A = 4
k = 1 / 256

# Equation to solve for V
V = sp.symbols('V')
equation = sp.Eq(P, k * A * V**3)

# Solve for V
solution = sp.solve(equation, V)
print(solution)
```
```output
[12.6992084157456, -6.3496042078728 + 11.1232129774803*I, -6.3496042078728 - 11.1232129774803*I]
```
The only real solution among the outputs is approximately \( 12.7 \). The other solutions are complex, which doesn't make physical sense in this context.

Therefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds is:

","Given:
- The pressure \( P \) varies jointly as the area \( A \) and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \).
- When \( V = 8 \) miles per hour and \( A = 2 \) square feet, \( P = 4 \) pounds.

We need to find \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet.

First, express the relationship mathematically:
$$
P = kA V^3
$$
where \( k \) is the constant of proportionality.

Using the first set of values (\( P = 4 \), \( A = 2 \), \( V = 8 \)):
$$
4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3
$$
Calculate \( 8^3 \):
$$
8^3 = 512
$$
So the equation becomes:
$$
4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512
$$
Simplify:
$$
4 = k \cdot 1024
$$
Solve for \( k \):
$$
k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256}
$$

Now use this \( k \) to find \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) and \( A = 4 \):
$$
32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3
$$
Simplify the equation:
$$
32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3
$$
$$
32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3
$$
Multiply both sides by 64 to isolate \( V^3 \):
$$
32 \cdot 64 = V^3
$$
$$
2048 = V^3
$$
Take the cube root of both sides to solve for \( V \):
$$
V = \sqrt[3]{2048}
$$
$$
V = 12.699
$$

Thus, the wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds is approximately \( 12.7 \) miles per hour.

Therefore, the final answer is:

1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**
   The pressure \(P\) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \(A\) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \(V\). This can be expressed as:
   \[
   P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3
   \]
   where \(k\) is a constant.

2. **Find the Constant \(k\):**
   We are given that when \(V = 8\) miles per hour, \(P = 4\) pounds and \(A = 2\) square feet. Substituting these values into the equation, we can solve for \(k\):
   \[
   4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 = k \cdot 1024
   \]
   Solving for \(k\), we get:
   \[
   k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256}
   \]

3. **Find the Wind Velocity When \(P = 32\) and \(A = 4\):**
   Now we need to find the wind velocity \(V\) when \(P = 32\) pounds and \(A = 4\) square feet. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
   \[
   32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3
   \]
   Solving for \(V^3\), we get:
   \[
   V^3 = 32 \cdot 64 = 2048
   \]
   Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
   \[
   V = \sqrt[3]{2048}
   \]

Let's implement this in Python using SymPy to find the value of \(V\).

First, we need to find the constant \( k \) using the given values: when \( V = 8 \) miles per hour, \( A = 2 \) square feet, and \( P = 4 \) pounds. We can substitute these values into the equation to find \( k \):

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]

Next, we can solve for \( k \):

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} \]
\[ k = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now that we have the constant \( k \), we can use it to find the wind velocity \( V \) when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds. We substitute \( P = 32 \), \( A = 4 \), and \( k = \frac{1}{256} \) into the equation:

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]

We can solve for \( V \):

\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]
\[ V = 12.7 \]

Let's use Python to verify this calculation.

","To solve this problem, we first need to express the relationship between the pressure \( P \), the area \( A \), and the velocity \( V \). The problem states that the pressure varies jointly as the area and the cube of the velocity. This means we can express the pressure \( P \) as:

\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality. We can determine the value of \( k \) using the given values \( P = 4 \) pounds, \( A = 2 \) square feet, and \( V = 8 \) miles per hour.

Once we have \( k \), we can use it to find the velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P = 32 \) pounds and the area \( A = 4 \) square feet.

Let's solve it step by step.

1. Calculate the constant \( k \).
2. Use the constant \( k \) to find the velocity \( V \) for the new pressure and area.

Let's start by finding \( k \):

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]

Solving for \( k \):

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now we use this constant \( k \) to find the velocity \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet:

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]

Given the function $f(x)=x^{2}+ax+b$ $(a,b \in \mathbb{R})$ has a range of $[0,+\infty)$, if the solution set of the inequality $f(x) < c$ is $(m, m+8)$, then the value of the real number $c$ is __________. To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Range of the Function:**
   The function \(f(x) = x^2 + ax + b\) has a range of \([0, +\infty)\). This means that the minimum value of the quadratic function is 0. The minimum value of a quadratic function \(f(x) = x^2 + ax + b\) occurs at \(x = -\frac{a}{2}\), and the value at this point is \(f\left(-\frac{a}{2}\right) = \left(-\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + a\left(-\frac{a}{2}\right) + b = \frac{a^2}{4} - \frac{a^2}{2} + b = b - \frac{a^2}{4}\). Since the minimum value is 0, we have:
   \[
   b - \frac{a^2}{4} = 0 \implies b = \frac{a^2}{4}
   \]
   So, the function can be written as:
   \[
   f(x) = x^2 + ax + \frac{a^2}{4} = \left(x + \frac{a}{2}\right)^2
   \]

2. **Understand the Inequality:**
   We need to find the solution set of the inequality \(f(x) < c\):
   \[
   \left(x + \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 < c
   \]
   Taking the square root on both sides, we get:
   \[
   -\sqrt{c} < x + \frac{a}{2} < \sqrt{c}
   \]
   Solving for \(x\), we get:
   \[
   -\sqrt{c} - \frac{a}{2} < x < \sqrt{c} - \frac{a}{2}
   \]
   This means the solution set is \(\left(-\sqrt{c} - \frac{a}{2}, \sqrt{c} - \frac{a}{2}\right)\). We are given that the solution set is \((m, m+8)\), so we can equate:
   \[
   m = -\sqrt{c} - \frac{a}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad m + 8 = \sqrt{c} - \frac{a}{"

","The pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail is directly proportional to the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). We can express this relationship with the formula:

\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

where \( k \) is the constant of proportionality.

First, we need to find the constant \( k \) using the given information. When the velocity \( V = 8 \) miles per hour and the area \( A = 2 \) square feet, the pressure \( P = 4 \) pounds. Plugging these values into the formula gives us:

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]

Now, we calculate \( 8^3 \):

\[ 8^3 = 8 \cdot 8 \cdot 8 = 512 \]

Substituting \( 512 \) back into the equation:

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]

To find \( k \), we divide both sides by \( 1024 \):

\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now that we have the constant \( k \), we can use it to find the wind velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P = 32 \) pounds and the area \( A = 4 \) square feet. Plugging these values into the formula gives us:

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]

First, we calculate \( \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \):

\[ \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 = \frac{4}{256} = \frac{1}{64} \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]

To find \( V^3 \), we multiply both sides by \( 64 \):

\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]

Now, we find \( V \) by taking the cube root of \( 2048 \):

\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]

We can simplify \( \sqrt[3]{2048} \) by recognizing that \( 2048 = 2^{11} \):

\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2^{11}} = 2^{\frac{11}{3}} = 2^3 \cdot 2^{\frac{2}{3}} = 8 \cdot \sqrt[3]{4} \]

Since we are dealing with practical applications and this is a simplified solution, we can approximate \( \sqrt[3]{4} \approx 1.587 \):

\[ V \approx 8 \cdot 1.587 \approx 12.7 \]

Therefore, the approximate wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds is:

\[ \boxed{12.7} \] miles per hour."

","Given the formula for pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail:

\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality, \( A \) is the area of the sail, and \( V \) is the velocity of the wind.

Step 1: Determine the constant \( k \).

We know that when \( V = 8 \) mph and \( A = 2 \) sq ft, the pressure \( P = 4 \) pounds. Substituting these values into the equation:

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]

Calculate \( 8^3 \):

Now, solve for \( k \):

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = 1024k \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} \]
\[ k = \frac{1}{256} \]

Step 2: Use the constant \( k \) to find the wind velocity when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) sq ft.

Substitute \( P = 32 \), \( A = 4 \), and \( k = \frac{1}{256} \) into the equation:

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]

To isolate \( V^3 \), multiply both sides by \( 64 \):

\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]

Now, take the cube root of both sides to solve for \( V \):

Calculate the cube root:

\[ V = 12.699 \approx 12.7 \, \text{mph} \]

\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now we can use this constant \( k \) to find the wind velocity \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet:

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]

Solving for \( V \):

\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]

","## Step-by-Step Solution

Given that the pressure \( P \) varies jointly as the area \( A \) and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \), we can write this relationship as:
\[ P = kA V^3 \]
where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.

1. **Find the Constant \( k \)**:
   - Given:
     \[ A = 2 \text{ square feet}, \quad V = 8 \text{ miles per hour}, \quad P = 4 \text{ pounds} \]
   - Plug these values into the equation to solve for \( k \):
     \[
     4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3
     \]
     \[
     4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512
     \]
     \[
     4 = 1024k
     \]
     \[
     k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256}
     \]

2. **Use the Constant \( k \) to Find \( V \) When \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet**:
   - Substitute \( k \), \( A \), and \( P \) into the equation:
     \[
     32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3
     \]
     \[
     32 = \frac{4V^3}{256}
     \]
     \[
     32 \cdot 256 = 4V^3
     \]
     \[
     8192 = 4V^3
     \]
     \[
     V^3 = \frac{8192}{4} = 2048
     \]
     \[
     V = \sqrt[3]{2048}
     \]

3. **Calculate \( V \)**:
   - Compute the cube root of 2048:
     \[
     V = \sqrt[3]{2048} = 12.6818
     \]

Thus, the wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds is approximately \( 12.68 \) miles per hour.

Let's confirm this with Python code for accuracy.
```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variables
A, V, P, k = sp.symbols('A V P k')

# Given values
A_val = 2
V_val = 8

equation = sp.Eq(P, k * A * V**3)

# Solve for k using the given values
k_val = sp.solve(equation.subs({P: P_val, A: A_val, V: V_val}), k)[0]

# New values

# Solve for V
V_new = sp.solve(new_equation, V)[0]
print(V_new.evalf())

The wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds is approximately \( 12.69 \) miles per hour.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12.69}
\]

The minimum positive period of the function $f(x)=\sin x\cdot(4\cos ^{2}x-1)$ is (　　).
A: $ \dfrac {\pi}{3}$
B: $ \dfrac {2\pi}{3}$
C: $\pi$
D: $2\pi$ To find the minimum positive period of the function \( f(x) = \sin x \cdot (4\cos^2 x - 1) \), we need to determine the smallest positive value \( T \) such that \( f(x + T) = f(x) \) for all \( x \).

First, let's simplify the expression for \( f(x) \):

\[ f(x) = \sin x \cdot (4\cos^2 x - 1) \]

We can use the double-angle identity for cosine, which states that \( \cos 2x = 2\cos^2 x - 1 \). So, we can rewrite \( 4\cos^2 x - 1 \) as \( 2(2\cos^2 x - 1) + 1 = 2\cos 2x + 1 \). Therefore, the function becomes:

\[ f(x) = \sin x \cdot (2\cos 2x + 1) = 2\sin x \cos 2x + \sin x \]

Now, we need to find the period of \( f(x) \). Since both \( \sin x \) and \( \cos 2x \) are periodic functions with periods \( 2\pi \) and \( \pi \) respectively, the function \( f(x) \) will be periodic with a period that is the least common multiple (LCM) of these periods.

The period of \( \sin x \) is \( 2\pi \) and the period of \( \cos 2x \) is \( \pi \). The LCM of \( 2\pi \) and \( \pi \) is \( 2\pi \), but since the function \( f(x) \) includes \( \sin x \), which has a period of \( 2\pi \), we need to check if there is a smaller period that satisfies the function.

","Given that \( P \) varies jointly with \( A \) and \( V^3 \), we can write the equation as:
\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

First, we find \( k \) using the given values \( P = 4 \) pounds, \( A = 2 \) square feet, and \( V = 8 \) miles per hour:
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = 1024k \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]

","First, we need to understand the problem statement. The pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail is directly proportional to the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). This can be expressed as:
\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]
where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.

We are given:
1. When \( V = 8 \) miles per hour and \( A = 2 \) square feet, \( P = 4 \) pounds.
2. We need to find the wind velocity \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet.

First, we can find the constant \( k \) using the given values:
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now we can use this constant to find the wind velocity \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet:
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]

\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]
\[ V = 12.699236612750118 \approx 12.70 \]

```
The solutions to the equation are approximately \( 12.70 \), \(-6.35 - 10.91i \), and \(-6.35 + 10.91i \). Since the velocity of the wind must be a real number, the valid solution is \( 12.70 \).

","To solve the problem, we need to use the concept of joint variation. The pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). This can be written mathematically as:

\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.

### Step 1: Determine the constant \( k \)

We are given:
- When \( V = 8 \) mph, \( P = 4 \) pounds, and \( A = 2 \) square feet.

Substitute these values into the equation to find \( k \):

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot (8^3) \]

First, calculate \( 8^3 \):

\[ 8^3 = 512 \]

Now substitute \( 512 \) into the equation:

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]

Solve for \( k \):

\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} \]
\[ k = \frac{1}{256} \]

### Step 2: Use the constant \( k \) to find the velocity \( V \)

We need to find the wind velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P = 32 \) pounds and the area \( A = 4 \) square feet. Use the equation:

\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

Substitute \( P = 32 \), \( A = 4 \), and \( k = \frac{1}{256} \):

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]

First, simplify the right-hand side:

\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]

To isolate \( V^3 \), multiply both sides by 64:

\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]

Now, solve for \( V \) by taking the cube root of both sides:

\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]

Calculate the cube root:

\[ V = 12.6992 \]

The pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). When the velocity is \( 8 \) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \( 2 \) square feet is \( 4 \) pounds.

<|im_start|>assistant
","To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Set up the equation that describes the relationship between the pressure \(P\), the area \(A\), and the wind velocity \(V\). Since the pressure varies jointly with the area and the cube of the wind velocity, we can write:
   \[
   P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3
   \]
   where \(k\) is a constant.

2. Use the given information to find the constant \(k\). When \(V = 8\) mph and \(A = 2\) square feet, \(P = 4\) pounds. So we can write:
   \[
   4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3
   \]
   Solving for \(k\):
   \[
   4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512
   \]
   \[
   4 = k \cdot 1024
   \]
   \[
   k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256}
   \]

3. Now we use the constant \(k\) to find the wind velocity \(V\) when the pressure \(P = 32\) pounds and the area \(A = 4\) square feet. So we can write:
   \[
   32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3
   \]
   \[
   32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3
   \]
   \[
   32 \cdot 64 = V^3
   \]
   \[
   2048 = V^3
   \]
   \[
   V = \sqrt[3]{2048}
   \]

4. Finally, we compute the cube root of 2048 to get the value of \(V\). Let's use Python to calculate this accurately.
```python
import sympy as sp

# Calculate the cube root of 2048
V = sp.Rational(2048)**(sp.Rational(1, 3))

The wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is approximately \( \boxed{12.70} \) miles per hour.

If the sum of the first $n$ terms of the sequence ${\_a\_n}$ is represented as $S\_n = \frac{2}{3}a\_n + \frac{1}{3}$, then the general term formula for the sequence ${\_a\_n}$ is $a\_n =$\_\_\_\_\_\_. To solve this problem, we need to find the general term \(a_n\) of the sequence given that the sum of the first \(n\) terms \(S_n = \frac{2}{3}a_n + \frac{1}{3}\).

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Find the first term \(a_1\):**
   When \(n = 1\), we have \(S_1 = a_1\). So, the equation becomes:
   \[
   a_1 = \frac{2}{3}a_1 + \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   Solving for \(a_1\), we get:
   \[
   a_1 - \frac{2}{3}a_1 = \frac{1}{3} \implies \frac{1}{3}a_1 = \frac{1}{3} \implies a_1 = 1
   \]

2. **Find the general term \(a_n\) for \(n \geq 2\):**
   For \(n \geq 2\), we have:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{2}{3}a_n + \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   And also:
   \[
   S_{n-1} = \frac{2}{3}a_{n-1} + \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   Since \(S_n = S_{n-1} + a_n\), we can substitute and get:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}a_n + \frac{1}{3} = \left(\frac{2}{3}a_{n-1} + \frac{1}{3}\right) + a_n
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}a_n + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}a_{n-1} + \frac{1}{3} + a_n \implies \frac{2}{3}a_n - a_n = \frac{2}{3}a_{n-1} \implies -\frac{1}{3}a_n = \frac{2}{3}a_{n-1} \implies a_n = -2a_{n-1}
   \]

3. **General term of the sequence:**
   Since \(a_1 = 1\) and \(a_n = -2a_{n-1}\) for \(n \geq 2\), we can see that the sequence is a geometric sequence with the first term \(a_1 = 1\) and common ratio \(r = -2\). The general term for a geometric sequence is given by:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1} = 1 \cdot (-2)^{n-1} = (-2)^{n-1}
   \]

\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]
\[ V = 12.699 \approx 12.7 \]

","Given the problem, we have that the pressure \( P \) is proportional to the area \( A \) and the cube of the velocity \( V \). This relationship can be expressed as:

\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

where \( k \) is the constant of proportionality.

First, we need to find the value of \( k \) using the initial conditions. We are given that when \( V = 8 \) miles per hour and \( A = 2 \) square feet, the pressure \( P = 4 \) pounds. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]

\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]

Now, solve for \( k \):

\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} \]
\[ k = \frac{1}{256} \]

Next, we need to find the wind velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P = 32 \) pounds and the area \( A = 4 \) square feet. Substituting these values into the equation:

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]

\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

where \( k \) is a constant.

Step 1: Use the given values to find the constant \( k \).

We know that when \( A = 2 \) square feet and \( V = 8 \) miles per hour, \( P = 4 \) pounds. Plugging these values into the equation gives us:

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]

First, calculate \( 8^3 \):

\[ 8^3 = 512 \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]

Simplify to find \( k \):

\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]

\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} \]

\[ k = \frac{1}{256} \]

Step 2: Use the constant \( k \) to find the wind velocity when \( A = 4 \) square feet and \( P = 32 \) pounds.

The equation is now:

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]

Simplify the right-hand side:

\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]

Multiply both sides by 64 to isolate \( V^3 \):

\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]

\[ 2048 = V^3 \]

Step 3: Solve for \( V \).

To find \( V \), take the cube root of both sides:

\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]

Simplify the cube root:

\[ V = 12.8 \] miles per hour

So, the wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds is \( 12.8 \) miles per hour.

","Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step using Python and SymPy.

1. **Understand the relationship**: The pressure \(P\) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \(A\) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \(V\). This means we can write the relationship as:
   \[
   P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3
   \]
   where \(k\) is a constant of proportionality.

2. **Find the constant \(k\)**: We are given that when \(V = 8\) miles per hour, \(P = 4\) pounds and \(A = 2\) square feet. We can use this information to find \(k\):
   \[
   4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3
   \]
   Solving for \(k\):
   \[
   4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \implies 4 = k \cdot 1024 \implies k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256}
   \]

3. **Use the constant \(k\) to find the wind velocity**: Now we need to find the wind velocity \(V\) when the pressure \(P = 32\) pounds and the area \(A = 4\) square feet. Using the relationship \(P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3\) and substituting \(k = \frac{1}{256}\), \(P = 32\), and \(A = 4\):
   \[
   32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3
   \]
   Simplifying the right-hand side:

   Solving for \(V\):
   \[
   V = \sqrt[3]{2048}

Let's implement this in Python using SymPy to find the value of \(V\).

```python

# Define the variable for velocity

wind_velocity = sp.simplify(wind_velocity)

The wind velocity when the pressure on a 4 square feet sail is 32 pounds is approximately \(12.69\) miles per hour. However, let's express the answer exactly in terms of a cube root.

From the equation \(2048 = V^3\), we can express the exact value of \(V\) as:
\[
V = \sqrt[3]{2048}
\]
Since \(2048 = 2^{11}\), we can simplify further:
\[
V = \sqrt[3]{2^{11}} = 2^{\frac{11}{3}} = 2^3 \cdot 2^{\frac{2}{3}} = 8 \cdot \sqrt[3]{4}
\]

Thus, the exact wind velocity is:

\boxed{8 \sqrt[3]{4}}

","The pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). This relationship can be expressed by the equation:

\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

Given that when \( V = 8 \) mph, \( A = 2 \) square feet, and \( P = 4 \) pounds, we can solve for \( k \):

We need to find the velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P = 32 \) pounds and the area \( A = 4 \) square feet:

","To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of joint variation. The pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). This can be expressed mathematically as:

where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.

Given:
1. When \( V = 8 \) miles per hour and \( A = 2 \) square feet, \( P = 4 \) pounds.

Let \( \frac{p}{q} \) be a rational number in lowest terms, where \( p \) and \( q \) are integers with \( q \neq 0 \). Define the function \( f(x) = \left\lfloor x \right\rfloor \) which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x \). 

Find the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( f\left( \frac{p}{q} + n \right) = f\left( \frac{p}{q} \right) \). To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of the floor function \( f(x) = \left\lfloor x \right\rfloor \). This function returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x \).

Let's consider the given rational number \( \frac{p}{q} \). We are looking for the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that adding \( n \) to \( \frac{p}{q} \) does not change the floor value.

First, note that if \( \frac{p}{q} \) is an integer, then \( f\left( \frac{p}{q} \right) = \frac{p}{q} \). If \( \frac{p}{q} \) is not an integer, then \( f\left( \frac{p}{q} \right) \) will be the greatest integer less than \( \frac{p}{q} \).

For the floor function to not change its value when adding \( n \), \( n \) must be such that it does not make \( \frac{p}{q} + n \) exceed the next integer. This implies that \( n \) must be less than 1, since any positive integer would increase \( \frac{p}{q} \) beyond its current floor value.

Therefore, the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies the condition is \( n = 1 \). This is because adding 1 to any rational number will generally increase its value, and thus its floor value unless it is already an integer.

Let's verify this with an example:

1. If \( \frac{p}{q} = 3 \) (an integer), then \( f\left( \frac{p}{q} \right) = 3 \). Adding any positive integer \( n \) (including \( n = 1 \)) will result in \( \frac{p}{q} + n = 3 + 1 = 4 \), and \( f(4) = 4 \). Thus, \( f\left( \frac{p}{q} + n \right) = f\left( \frac{p}{q} \right) \).

2. If \( \frac{p}{q} = 3.2 \) (not an integer), then \( f\left( \frac{p}{q} \right) = 3 \). Adding any positive integer \( n \) (including \( n = 1 \)) will result in \( \frac{p}{q} + n = 3.2 +"

3. We need to find the velocity \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet:
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 \cdot 64 = V^3 \]
\[ 2048 = V^3 \]
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]
\[ V = 12.6992 \approx 12.7 \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{12.7} \]
```python

","We are given that the pressure \( P \) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \( A \) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \( V \). This can be written as:
\[ P = k A V^3 \]
where \( k \) is a constant.

We are also given that when \( V = 8 \) miles per hour and \( A = 2 \) square feet, the pressure \( P \) is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the constant \( k \):

This can be expressed mathematically as:
\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

where \( k \) is the constant of proportionality.

### Step 1: Finding the constant of proportionality \( k \)

First, we use the given values to find \( k \).

Given:
- \( P = 4 \) pounds
- \( A = 2 \) square feet
- \( V = 8 \) miles per hour

Substituting these values into the equation:
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]

We need to calculate \( 8^3 \):

So the equation becomes:
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]

Now, solve for \( k \):
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} \]
\[ k = \frac{1}{256} \]

### Step 2: Using the constant \( k \) to find the new velocity \( V \)

We need to find the wind velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P \) is \( 32 \) pounds and the area \( A \) is \( 4 \) square feet.

Using the equation:
\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

Substitute \( P = 32 \), \( A = 4 \), and \( k = \frac{1}{256} \):
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]

Simplify the right-hand side:
\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]

Now, solve for \( V^3 \):
\[ V^3 = 32 \times 64 \]
\[ V^3 = 2048 \]

To find \( V \), take the cube root of both sides:
\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]

Calculate the cube root:
\[ V = 12.8 \]

### Final Answer

Thus, the answer is:

When the velocity is \( 8 \) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \( 2 \) square feet is \( 4 \) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \( 4 \) square feet of sail is \( 32 \) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{}.<|im_end|>

","Given:
1. The pressure \( P \) varies jointly with the area \( A \) and the cube of the velocity \( V \). So, \( P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \) for some constant \( k \).
2. When \( V = 8 \) mph and \( A = 2 \) square feet, \( P = 4 \) pounds. We can use this to find \( k \).

First, we'll determine \( k \):

\[
4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3
\]

\[
4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512
\]

\[
4 = k \cdot 1024
\]

\[
k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256}
\]

Now, we'll use \( k = \frac{1}{256} \) to find the velocity \( V \) when \( P = 32 \) pounds and \( A = 4 \) square feet:

\[
32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3
\]

\[
32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3
\]

\[
32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3
\]

\[
32 \cdot 64 = V^3
\]

\[
2048 = V^3
\]

\[
V = \sqrt[3]{2048}
\]

Let's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.
```python
# Given values
P_given = 32  # pressure in pounds
A_given = 4   # area in square feet
k = 1/256     # constant k calculated from the initial conditions

# Calculate the velocity V
V_cubed = P_given / (k * A_given)
V = V_cubed ** (1/3)

print(V)
```
```output
12.699208415745595

","First, we express the relationship between the pressure \( P \), the area \( A \), and the wind's velocity \( V \) mathematically. According to the problem, the pressure \( P \) varies jointly as the area \( A \) and the cube of the velocity \( V \). This can be written as:

\[ P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \]

where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.

Given the first scenario, when \( A = 2 \) square feet and \( V = 8 \) miles per hour, the pressure \( P \) is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the constant \( k \):

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]

First, calculate \( 8^3 \):

\[ 8^3 = 512 \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} \]
\[ k = \frac{1}{256} \]

Now we have the constant \( k \). Next, we need to find the velocity \( V \) when the pressure \( P \) is 32 pounds and the area \( A \) is 4 square feet. We use the same equation \( P = k \cdot A \cdot V^3 \) and substitute the known values:

\[ 32 = \frac{1}{256} \cdot 4 \cdot V^3 \]

Simplify the right side of the equation:

\[ 32 = \frac{4}{256} \cdot V^3 \]
\[ 32 = \frac{1}{64} \cdot V^3 \]

Now, solve for \( V^3 \):

\[ V^3 = 32 \cdot 64 \]
\[ V^3 = 2048 \]

Take the cube root of both sides to solve for \( V \):

\[ V = \sqrt[3]{2048} \]

Using Python to get the exact value:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the cube root of 2048
V = sp.cbrt(2048)
print(V)
```
```output
8*2**(1/3)
```
The cube root of 2048 is \( 8 \cdot 2^{1/3} \). We can simplify this further to get the exact value. Since \( 2048 = 2^{11} \), we can take the cube root:

\[ 2048 = 2^{11} \]
\[ \sqrt[3]{2048} = \sqrt[3]{2^{11}} = 2^{11/3} = 2^3 \cdot 2^{2/3} = 8 \cdot 2^{2/3} = 8 \cdot \sqrt[3]{4} \]

Thus, the exact value of \( V \) is \( 8 \cdot \sqrt[3]{4} \).

So the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{8 \cdot \sqrt[3]{4}} \]"

First, we need to find the constant \( k \). Given that when the velocity \( V = 8 \) miles per hour, the pressure \( P = 4 \) pounds on a sail of \( A = 2 \) square feet, we can substitute these values into the equation:
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 8^3 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 2 \cdot 512 \]
\[ 4 = k \cdot 1024 \]
\[ k = \frac{4}{1024} = \frac{1}{256} \]

So the wind velocity is approximately \( 12.7 \) miles per hour. Let's confirm this with Python code.
```python

k = P1 / (A1 * V1**3)

# Calculate the velocity V2
V2 = (P2 / (k * A2))**(1/3)
